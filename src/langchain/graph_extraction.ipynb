Saving, however, can take a little practice.\\n\\nThis article offers practical advice on how—and where—to save for three big goals: financial emergencies, college, and retirement. But the strategies it outlines can apply to many other goals, such as saving for a new car, a down payment on a home, the vacation of a lifetime, or launching your own business.\\n\\nBefore you get started, it’s worth taking a look at any outstanding debts you have. It makes little sense to pay 17% in interest on credit card debt while earning 1% (or even lower in some cases) on a savings account. So consider tackling the two in tandem, putting some money toward savings and some toward your credit balances. The sooner you can pay off that high-interest debt, the sooner you’ll have to put more into your savings.\\n\\nKey Takeaways Employer-sponsored retirement plans like 401(k)s make saving for retirement easy and automatic, and some employers even match your contributions.\\n\\nState-run 529 college savings plans let you withdraw money tax-free as long as you use it for qualified education expenses.\\n\\nBy tracking your expenses manually or with an app, you can find ways to reduce your spending and boost your savings.\\n\\nBuilding Emergency Savings\\n\\nThe goal for most individuals and families should be an emergency fund that's large enough to handle serious, unexpected expenses, such as a costly car repair, medical bill, or both. An emergency or rainy day fund can also tide you over for a while if you lose your job and need to hunt for a new one.\\n\\nHow Much Should You Save?\\n\\nUnless you’re already a big saver, your take-home pay is a fair approximation of your monthly living expenses, and it’s easily found on your pay stubs or bank statements. Financial planners commonly recommend setting aside at least three months of living expenses. Others say you should put away anywhere between six months to a year's worth of expenses.\\n\\nThese figures work for retirees as well. But it's always a good idea to make a few extra calculations. Consider all of your monthly expenses and contrast that with your monthly income, including Social Security, pensions, liquid assets, and investment income. You'll also want to factor in the risk associated with any stocks and other volatile investments you have in a bear market.\\n\\nWhere to Park Your Cash\\n\\nTo access your money quickly in an emergency, the best place to keep it is in a liquid account, such as a checking, savings, or money market account at a bank or credit union, or a money market fund at a mutual fund company or brokerage firm. If the account earns a little interest, all the better.\\n\\nIn most cases, these accounts will allow you to write a check, pay a bill online, or use an app on your phone. You can also move money by electronic wire transfer from your account to someone else’s when you need to do so. If you get a debit card when you open your account, you’ll be able to withdraw cash from an automated teller machine (ATM).\\n\\nFunding Your Account\\n\\nConsider using all or part of any money you earn outside of your usual paycheck. That may be a tax refund, a bonus, or income from a side gig. If you receive a raise, try to contribute at least a portion of that to your account as well.\\n\\nAnother time-honored tip is to pay yourself first. This means treating your savings like any other bill and earmarking a certain percentage of every paycheck to go into it. To avoid the temptation of simply spending the money, consider direct deposit. Or you can have it deposited to your checking account and then transferred automatically to your emergency fund.\\n\\nSaving for a rainy day is certainly easier said than done for many of us. For instance, someone who nets $50,000 a year would need to set aside anywhere between $12,500 to $25,000. If they devoted 10% to emergency savings, it would take two and a half years in the first instance and five years in the second, not counting any additional contributions or interest the account might earn.\\n\\nIf you ever need to take money out of your emergency fund, make sure you replenish it as soon as possible.\\n\\nSaving for Retirement\\n\\nRetirement is the single largest savings goal for many of us. But the challenge can be daunting. Fortunately, there are several smart ways to set money aside, many of them with tax advantages as an added incentive. Besides a bank or credit union savings account, there are individual retirement accounts (IRAs) for just about anybody. Tax-advantaged accounts include 401(k) plans for private-sector employees and 403(b) plans for employees of schools and nonprofits.\\n\\nEmployer-Sponsored Plans\\n\\nThe easiest, most automatic way to save for retirement is through an employer plan, such as a 401(k). The money comes out of your paycheck automatically and goes into whatever mutual funds or other investments you’ve chosen.\\n\\nYou don’t have to pay income tax on that money, on the interest, or on any dividends your plan earns until you eventually take it out. For 2024, you can put up to $23,000 a year into a 401(k) plan, which is an increase from the $22,500 limit for 2023.\\n\\nIf you're 50 and over, you can contribute an additional $7,500 (for both 2023 and 2024). As still another incentive, many employers will match your contributions up to a certain level. For instance, if your employer kicks in another 50%, a $10,000 investment on your part will be worth $15,000.\\n\\nThe table below shows you how compounding works with your retirement savings, assuming you invest the full $23,000 every year and are guaranteed a 5% return each year.\")),\n",

The truth is, it depends on your financial situation. What everyone needs to keep in the bank from month to month is enough to cover the regular bills and discretionary spending, and a bit over for an emergency fund.\\n\\nIn addition to keeping funds in a bank account, you should also keep between $100 and $300 cash in your wallet and about $1,000 in a safe at home for unexpected expenses.\\n\\nEverything starts with your budget. If you don\\'t budget correctly, you don\\'t know how much you need to keep in your bank account. If you don\\'t have one, now’s the time to develop one.\\n\\nKey Takeaways The 50/30/20 rule and financial guru Dave Ramsey’s method are two popular approaches to budgeting.\\n\\nBoth recommend allocating money monthly to regular monthly bills, discretionary spending, and an emergency fund in a high-yield savings account.\\n\\nAll of these should be kept in \"cash.\" That means a checking account that allows you immediate access to your money when you need it.\\n\\nThe 50/30/20 Rule\\n\\nFirst, let\\'s look at the ever-popular 50/30/20 budget rule.\\n\\nSenator Elizabeth Warren introduced this rule in the book, \"All Your Worth: The Ultimate Lifetime Money Plan,\" which she co-authored with her daughter. Instead of trying to follow a complicated, crazy-number-of-lines budget, you can think of your money as sitting in three buckets.\\n\\nCosts That Don\\'t Change: 50%\\n\\nIt would be nice if you didn\\'t have monthly bills, but the electricity bill comes, just like the water, Internet, car, and mortgage or rent bills. Assuming you\\'ve evaluated how these costs fit into your budget and decided they are musts, there\\'s not much you can do other than pay them.\\n\\nFixed costs should eat up around 50% of your monthly budget.\\n\\nGranted, not all of these costs are fixed. Electricity costs, for example, change with the seasons. But you should get a good sense over time of approximately how much you\\'ll need to cover the expense every month.\\n\\nDiscretionary Money: 30%\\n\\nThis is the bucket where anything (within reason) goes. It’s your money to use on wants instead of needs.\\n\\nInterestingly, most planners include food in this bucket not because eating is discretionary but because the costs vary so widely depending on your habits and preferences. You can eat at a restaurant or cook at home, you can buy generic or name brands, and you can buy flank steak or prime rib.\\n\\nWhatever you choose, list it under discretionary, at least as a constant reminder that you can cut back on fine dining if you\\'re busting this part of your budget every month.\\n\\nThis bucket also includes a movie, buying a new tablet, or contributing to charity. You decide.\\n\\nThe general rule is 30% of your income, but many financial gurus argue that 30% is much too high.\\n\\nFinancial Goals: 20%\\n\\nIf you\\'re not aggressively saving for the future—funding an IRA or 401(k), a 529 plan if you have kids, or another retirement plan, if possible—you\\'re setting yourself up for hard times ahead. This is where the final 20% of your monthly income should go.\\n\\nThis funding is essential for your future. Retirement funds like IRAs and Roth IRAs can be set up through most brokerages.\\n\\nIf you don\\'t have an emergency fund, most of this 20% should go first to creating one. This is the accessible cash that you can turn to when the roof falls in, literally or figuratively.\\n\\nThe percentages of the 50/30/20 rule should be applied to your after-tax income, which is your take-home pay.\\n\\nAnother Budget Strategy: Dave Ramsey\\'s Method\\n\\nFinancial guru Dave Ramsey has a slightly different take on how you should carve up your cash. His recommended allocations look something like this (expressed as a percentage of your take-home pay):\\n\\nCharitable Giving: 10% to 15%\\n\\nSavings: 10% to 15%\\n\\nFood: 10% to 15%\\n\\nUtilities: 5% to 10%\\n\\nHousing: 25% to 35%\\n\\nTransportation: 10% to 15%\\n\\nHealth: 5% to 10%\\n\\nInsurance: 10% to 25%\\n\\nRecreation/Entertainment: 5% to 10%\\n\\nPersonal Spending: 10% to 15%\\n\\nAbout That Emergency Fund\\n\\nBeyond your monthly living expenses and discretionary money, the major portion of the cash reserves in your bank account should consist of your emergency fund. The money for that fund should come from the portion of your budget devoted to savings—whether it\\'s from the 20% of the 50/30/20 method or Ramsey\\'s 10% to 15% estimate.\\n\\nHow much do you need? Everybody has a different opinion. Most financial experts suggest you need a cash stash equal to six months of expenses: If you need $5,000 to survive every month, save $30,000.\\n\\nPersonal finance guru Suze Orman advises an eight-month emergency fund because that’s about how long it takes the average person to find a job. Other experts say three months, while some say none at all if you have little debt, a lot of money saved in liquid investments, and good-quality insurance.\\n\\nShould that fund really be in the bank? Some of those same experts will advise you to keep your five-figure emergency fund in an investment account with relatively safe allocations to earn more than the paltry interest you will receive in a savings account.\\n\\nThe main issue is that the money is instantly accessible if you need it. And there\\'s virtually no risk of losses if the money is in an FDIC-insured bank account.\\n\\nIf you don’t have an emergency fund, you should probably build one even before putting your savings money toward retirement or other goals. Aim to build the fund to three months of expenses, then split your savings between a savings account and investments until you have six to eight months\\' worth tucked away.\\n\\nAfter that, your savings should go into retirement and other goals—investing in something that earns more than a bank account.\\n\\nHow Much Should I Keep in Checking?\\n\\nChecking accounts are designed to handle everyday transactions, such as depositing paychecks, paying bills, and withdrawing cash for daily expenses.\\n\\nThe amount of money in your checking account should be enough to cover the bills and the daily expenses so that you don’t get hit with overdraft fees.\\n\\nIt should also include a buffer. Buffers should make you feel comfortable, but not so comfortable that you\\'re tempted to overspend.\\n\\nHow Much Cash Should I Keep on Hand? We\\'ll interpret \"cash on hand\" as money that is immediately available for use in an unexpected emergency. That should include a little cash stashed in the house, enough to cover the monthly bills in a checking account, and enough to cover an emergency in a savings account. For the emergency stash, most financial experts set an ambitious goal of the equivalent of six months of income. A regular savings account is \"liquid.\" That is, your money is safe and you can access it at any time without a penalty and with no risk of a loss of your principal. In return, you get a small amount of interest. Check rates online as they vary greatly among banks.\\n\\nHow Much Cash Should My Business Have on Hand? The U.S. Chamber of Commerce recommends that a business keep three to six months\\' worth of operating expenses on hand. As in the case of your personal finances, this means \"liquid\" money that can be accessed as needed.\\n\\nHow Much Cash Should I Take When Traveling? Unless you\\'re going to a truly remote part of the world, your usual cash habits will work where you\\'re going. Your ATM card should work at any major bank\\'s ATM, and you can get cash in the local currency. Your major credit cards should work for purchases as usual. (You will pay a foreign currency fee for every transaction. The amount can be found in the fine print on their websites.) You will find that cash is preferred to plastic in many places outside the U.S., particularly outside the big cities.\\n\\nThe Bottom Line\\n\\nFederal Reserve data from the Report on the Economic Well-Being of U.S. Households in 2023 revealed that 63% of Americans would be able to come up with $400 or less in cash or its equivalent to pay for an emergency expense.\\n\\nMost financial gurus would probably agree that if you start saving something, that’s a great first step. Plan to raise that amount over time.')),\n",

Liquidate Your Assets\\n\\nDoes the corner of your jewelry box hold your dad\\'s Rolex, your mom\\'s engagement ring, or a diamond pin you rarely wear? What about goodies tucked away in your closet—perhaps a fancy bridesmaid dress or your inherited great-aunt\\'s fur coat?\\n\\nOne online platform ready and willing to pay cash for your clothes is thredUp. In the Help Center, click on \"The Clean Out Process\" to find out how the selling process works. Or, you can try selling your clothing on eBay or Facebook Marketplace.\\n\\nYou also may be able to make fast cash by selling recent-model electronics, such as big-screen TVs, tablets, phones, laptops, and game consoles, as well as media like DVDs, CDs, books, and games. For these, check out sites such as Decluttr, Gazelle, and uSell, and marketplace sites like Swappa.\\n\\nOr, try posting your items on Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist, and X (formerly Twitter); run an ad in your local newspaper; or peddle these pieces to friends and family members.\\n\\nDepending on the quality of the garments, electronics, and media you\\'re willing to sell, you could quickly rake in hundreds—or more—in much-needed cash.\\n\\n2. Take on Odd Jobs\\n\\nIf you don\\'t have any high-value items to unload, you can try selling your services instead, either as a second job but especially if you are out of work and have time on your hands.\\n\\nYou might babysit and/or start up a neighborhood dog-walking service. According to ZipRecruiter, the nationwide average hourly wage for a babysitter is $18 an hour. Dog walkers can typically earn about $15 an hour, according to PayScale.\\n\\nIf you\\'re not up for dealing with dogs or kids, you might offer to mow the grass and wash cars for people in your neighborhood, or drive an elderly neighbor to their doctor appointments.\\n\\nOr, if you enjoy driving, you might sign up to be a Lyft or Uber driver. According to ZipRecruiter, Uber drivers average an hourly rate nationally of $19.\\n\\nYou could also grocery shop for busy friends or older adults, or offer to repair and paint a friend\\'s or relative\\'s dilapidated fence. Depending on how many jobs you take on and how much you charge for each task, you could scrape together a few hundred bucks within a single weekend.\\n\\nIf you can\\'t find enough people who need work done, try signing up for jobs through websites such as TaskRabbit, Thumbtack, or skills-based work in Upwork, Freelancer, or Fiverr.\\n\\nAn emergency fund can provide a financial cushion to help when unexpected costs associated with, for instance, medical treatment or the loss of a job, occur. Start setting money aside for your fund as soon as you can.\\n\\n3. Track Down Loose Change\\n\\nAt first glance, this advice may seem a little absurd, but it\\'s not a joke. According to the Wall Street Journal, Americans lose track of as much as $68 million of coins each year. That\\'s a lot of money stuffed in couch cushions, piggy banks, and old paint cans across the nation.\\n\\nHunt around the house to collect all those hidden coins. Once you dig up every last cent, haul the trove to your local bank or credit union. Some banks will count change for free for their customers. Others may require you to count and roll your change on your own.\\n\\nAnother way to track down lost money is to visit your state\\'s unclaimed property website. For any state you\\'ve lived in, there may be funds that belong to you (e.g., a check or a forgotten bank account). The state is required to hold on to these funds, and it publishes a list of those owed money. Once you follow the instructions to claim the funds, essentially you\\'ve found money that you forgot or never knew you had.\\n\\n4. Organize a Garage Sale\\n\\nOne man\\'s trash is another man\\'s treasure, as the saying goes. While garage and yard sales require a lot of work, they can bring in a decent chunk of change for some sellers.\\n\\nBe sure to advertise on Craigslist, Facebook (if you have a local group), Nextdoor, your local newspaper (online as well as print), and church bulletins. Put up large, easy-to-read signs with black lettering in key locations to bring in as many people as possible.\\n\\n5. Tap Your Retirement Account\\n\\nFor significant amounts of money, the first four options above may not suffice. That\\'s when it may make sense to consider your 401(k). In most years, if you\\'re younger than 59½, you pay a 10% penalty for withdrawing from your 401(k) funds. But when you face especially trying times, it may be worth it.\\n\\nAlso, there are certain exceptions for which the 10% penalty may be waived, such as when you have unreimbursed medical expenses that exceed 7.5% of your modified adjusted gross income. You can also borrow, rather than withdraw, money from your 401(k), a better choice if you can manage it.\\n\\nIf you don\\'t have a 401(k) but you do have an IRA, this could also be a source of funds, especially if it\\'s a Roth IRA. With a traditional IRA, your options are more limited, but even then, there are some situations in which you can withdraw retirement money at little cost to you.\\n\\n6. Part With Your Plasma\\n\\nNow we\\'re getting to the more extreme options. Plasma is a valuable resource used for a variety of medical treatments and research. Donating plasma is similar to giving blood, according to Octapharma Plasma Inc., a company that collects plasma used to create life-saving medicines for patients worldwide.\\n\\nOnce your blood is drawn, it\\'s cycled through special equipment that separates plasma from the other parts of your blood. Your plasma is then collected in a container, while the other parts are safely returned to your body in a process called plasmapheresis.\\n\\nReports vary as to how much you can make, and it will depend on a variety of factors. According to the Octapharma Plasma website, hermatocrit, height, and weight drive payment amounts. First-time donors receive a bonus. Returning donors receive greater payment amounts depending on the frequency of donations.\\n\\n7. Borrow Money From Friends or Family\\n\\nWe saved this one for last because it really should be a last resort. While borrowing money from friends and relatives may be a quick fix, it can lead to some adverse and unpleasant consequences. When a loved one lends you some cash, it can put a strain on your relationship—especially if you don\\'t pay the person back quickly.\\n\\nUnpaid loans can lead to lingering bad feelings between the lender and borrower. If you plan on borrowing money, it\\'s probably best to draw up a contract that states when you must begin to pay back the lender, when you will finish paying, and any interest you\\'ll owe on the money borrowed.\\n\\nHow Much Should I Have in Emergency Savings? Different financial advisers may give different answers. Some suggest a minimum of three months of living expenses, while other err on the side of caution and recommend between 6 and 12 months. Be mindful of how your emergency savings goals may change if you were to move from one area to another which has a higher cost of living.\\n\\nWhere Should I Store My Emergency Fund? Your emergency fund should be kept someplace safe and liquid. For this reason, a savings account may be the most logical place to start. You\\'ll be able to withdraw your money whenever you need it (and high-yield savings accounts may offer especially attractive interest rates). Put your savings in a financial institution that you trust and an account that you understand.\\n\\nWhat Are the Tax Implications of Selling Things I Own? If you were to make a profit on anything you own, that gain is technically taxable income. Your tax rate would ultimately depend on the length of time you possessed the good. Keep good records (sales receipts, emails, bank statements) of what you sell, especially if you sell things for less than what you paid for. In some cases, your losses may be able to offset your taxable gains. A tax advisor can provide insight about the tax implications.\\n\\nThe Bottom Line\\n\\nIf you find yourself cash-strapped when a financial emergency strikes, you\\'re not alone. The vast majority of Americans don\\'t have enough cash on hand to pay for unexpected expenses.\\n\\nAt such a time, the worst thing you can do is drive up credit card debt or take out a payday loan, which will have exorbitant interest rates.\\n\\nFortunately, there are several ways to raise money quickly without decimating your finances. Whether you choose to sell some of your belongings, take on odd jobs, or borrow money from a parent or friend, one thing is sure.

These terms are often used interchangeably, but they represent different approaches to your personal finances.\\n\\nYou’ll want to consider both saving and investing at different points in your life, but the key is to understand the pros and cons of each, and how they fit into the bigger picture of your financial journey.\\n\\nKey Takeaways Understanding the purpose of saving and investing helps in making informed financial decisions.\\n\\nFactors such as time horizon, risk tolerance, and financial goals may influence your choice to save or invest.\\n\\nSaving offers low risk and quick access to funds, while investing provides the potential for higher returns and wealth growth.\\n\\nDetermining the right approach requires evaluation of your personal financial situation, goals, and comfort with saving and investing.\\n\\nUnderstanding Saving and Investing\\n\\nSaving refers to setting aside cash in a low-risk, low-return environment. This could include traditional or online savings accounts at banks, money market accounts, certificates of deposit (CDs), or even a situation in which you hold onto cash outside of a financial institution.\\n\\nMoney held in one of these settings is more liquid than money in most investment types, meaning you can access it more quickly and easily if necessary for emergencies or short-term goals. However, in exchange for carrying a lower level of risk than investments, these methods of saving money also provide less of a reward—in this case, they offer lower rates of return.\\n\\nInvesting your money means buying any of several different investment vehicles that carry a higher risk and, potentially, a higher reward. Investments may include stocks, bonds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), commodities, real estate, and more.\\n\\nNot all investment vehicles carry the same levels of risk and reward. Some, such as bonds, may require months or even years before reaching maturity.\\n\\n\\n\\nSimilarly, there are many ways to access investments, including through retirement accounts, mutual funds, individual stock trading, and more. However, regardless of the type of investment or its particular risk and reward profile, the goal of all investments is the same: to grow your wealth over the long term.\\n\\nFactors to Consider When Deciding to Save or Invest\\n\\nBoth saving and investing involve setting aside money now for a future goal or expense. However, the time horizon, level of risk, and most pertinent financial goals vary depending on whether you are looking at saving or investing your money.\\n\\nTaking a close look at each of these factors can help you determine what to prioritize:\\n\\nTime Horizon\\n\\nOne of the biggest considerations when deciding whether to save or invest is the time horizon of your financial goals. Some goals have a limited scope or a definite endpoint. In these cases, it may make the most sense to keep your money easily accessible in a savings account or similar vehicle, as you will not hold the money long enough for it to grow significantly in an investment setting.\\n\\nBradley Baskir, vice president and financial advisor at Morgan Stanley in Boston, says that saving is usually preferred “when the time horizon for liquidity is under 12 months.” He adds that saving for short-term goals by “depositing that pool of money in a savings account may make more sense than investing it because [you] can feel confident that the money will be there” when the goal arrives.\\n\\nOn the other hand, other financial goals may be more significant or more open-ended. If you’re planning for retirement, you are more likely thinking years or even decades ahead. Longer-term goals like these benefit from an investment-centered approach. The longer time horizon of these priorities means your money will have the opportunity to grow more significantly if it is invested, and you will not need it to be liquid until you get close to reaching the goal at some point in the future.\\n\\nRisk Tolerance\\n\\nAnother key factor when deciding about saving or investing is your risk tolerance. Risk tolerance refers to the degree of risk that you are willing to take on given the potential volatility of a financial decision.\\n\\nSaving your money is less risky than investing it. If you invest your money, you stand to potentially lose your principal, or initial investment.\\n\\nConsider a situation in which you’re looking ahead to a longer-term financial goal. Given time horizon alone, you might be inclined to assume investing is the best approach. However, if you’re also facing uncertainty regarding your job stability, or there are ongoing periods of volatility in the market, or you’re otherwise unsure of what your financial situation will be, it may be safest to put your money in a savings account instead.\\n\\nEach person has a different risk tolerance, which is distinct from that person’s risk capacity, or capability to take on risk. Your risk tolerance may be dependent upon factors such as your age, financial goals, and income, among other factors.\\n\\nFinancial Goals\\n\\nLaying out clear financial goals will help you to decide when it is appropriate to save or invest—or a combination of both. Financial goals may be large, such as preparing for a down payment on a home, a new vehicle, college tuition, or planning for retirement. They may also be more modest, such as saving for a small purchase or a short weekend trip.\\n\\nThe nature of your financial goals will influence your decision to save or invest. If your goal requires quick access to cash, you’ll likely opt to hold money in a savings account or similarly liquid space.\\n\\nOn the other hand, if you’re hoping for better returns on your money than can be achieved with savings account interest rates and over a long time, then investing may be the answer.\\n\\nMany financial advisors recommend setting aside an emergency fund in a liquid account before considering investing.\\n\\nPros and Cons of Saving\\n\\nSaving offers security but lower potential for rewards.\\n\\nPros Saving your money entails a low level of risk.\\n\\nSome methods of saving are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. or the National Credit Union Administration.\\n\\nSavings and similar accounts typically make it easy to access your funds.\\n\\nEase of use; most of these accounts do not require regular upkeep or observation. Cons Lower potential returns compared to investing.\\n\\nPotential for savings accounts to fail to keep up with inflation, eroding your purchasing power over medium- and long-term time horizons.\\n\\nPros and Cons of Investing\\n\\nLikewise, investing offers both benefits and downsides. Baskir notes that “investing is by nature a trade-off between risk and return, so those who are willing to stay the course in a diversified portfolio, over long periods of time, in any market environment, should stand to be rewarded with returns that outperform that of cash equivalents earned from saving alone.”\\n\\nPros Investing provides the potential for (significantly) higher returns than saving. As your investments grow, they allow you to take advantage of compounding to accelerate gains.\\n\\nInvesting offers many different access points and strategies, from individual stocks and bonds to mutual or exchange-traded funds.\\n\\nInvesting your money allows you to buy into companies, industries, and sectors that interest you or that you support. Cons In some cases, investments are less liquid than savings. It may take more time to access your funds, and it could potentially cost you money, as in the case of withdrawing early from retirement accounts.\\n\\nMarkets for stocks, commodities, real estate, and other assets are often highly volatile, meaning that you may not achieve gains and may even lose some of your principal.\\n\\nSome approaches to investing are very hands-on and require both time and specialized knowledge.\\n\\nInvestors are subject to biases and emotion-based decision making, which can adversely impact their investments.\\n\\nDetermining the Right Approach\\n\\nBaskir says that “saving is to walking what investing is to running.” He adds that it’s vital to “have enough saved up for a rainy day, typically equal to three to six months worth of expenses in the event of a layoff, health issues,” or other unexpected changes to a financial situation before investing.\\n\\nTo determine the best approach for you, consider this checklist:\\n\\nDo you have an adequate cash cushion to cover three to six months of fixed expenses? If not, start saving.\\n\\nDo you have other short-term goals requiring quick access to cash (like travel plans)? If so, start saving.\\n\\nAre you on track to reach your retirement goals by your desired age? If not, start investing.\\n\\nDo you understand the risks involved in investing this money for a long-term goal such as retirement? You may not be able to access it until age 59½ without taxes and a penalty, plus you’ll face volatility risk, etc.\\n\\nAre you comfortable waiting to access your money in order to take advantage of compounding? If so, you may want to start investing.\\n\\nDo you feel comfortable with your current split of saving and investing every month? Where does it feel like you’re falling short?\\n\\nSaving vs. Investing: Example\\n\\nLet’s say that you are in your late 30s, single, and making a six-figure income. Currently, you have about two months of expenses in savings and just over a year’s salary in your company-sponsored 401(k). You also recently paid off your student loans and have $500 to reallocate to your other financial goals, which include:\\n\\nBoosting your emergency fund to cover at least three months of expenses\\n\\nIncreasing your retirement savings to ensure that you will be able to retire at age 67 with an income that covers your needs\\n\\nPutting aside extra money for travel\\n\\nThe amount you decide to contribute to each category depends on your priorities. It’s also subject to change; for example, you might decide that in the short term, creating an emergency fund that covers three months of expenses is most important. Once that goal is funded, you can move on to putting more money toward retirement (and fun).\\n\\nWhen to Save\\n\\nSaving may be the best option for you if you have yet to establish a rainy-day fund if you have a short-term financial goal, if you expect to need access to your funds on short notice, or if your risk tolerance is low and you want to protect your principal.\\n\\nChoosing a Savings Account\\n\\nA variety of savings accounts are available today, including traditional accounts, online-only accounts, high-yield accounts, money market funds, and more. Look to Investopedia’s in-depth guide for an overview of many of the most popular savings account options and suggestions on how to pick the right account for you.\\n\\nWhen to Invest\\n\\nInvesting could be the choice for you if you already have an emergency fund and if you are planning for a long-term financial goal, if you’re seeking compounding interest on your funds, if you have the flexibility to hold your funds in a less accessible account, or if you have a higher risk tolerance.\\n\\nChoosing a Brokerage Account\\n\\nSelecting a way to invest your money can be a much more complex question than selecting a savings account. Most beginning investors will use a brokerage account to facilitate trades. Many of the leading brokerages offer an easy-to-use interface, free trades in certain cases, and access to a variety of assets including stocks, mutual and exchange-traded funds, and more.\\n\\nIt pays to consider the ways you plan to invest—actively or passively, what types of asset classes you will target, and so on—and to use Investopedia’s guide to select a broker.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat Are the Advantages of Saving Money Instead of Investing It? Some of the advantages of saving over investing include a lower level of risk, easier access to your funds, and a comparably straightforward process.\\n\\nWhat Factors Should Be Considered When Deciding Between Saving and Investing? Keep in mind your financial goals—large or small, necessary or discretionary—and what the time horizons of those goals are. Your appetite for risk is also important. You can also allocate some funds to saving and some to investing in order to achieve both short- and long-term priorities.\\n\\n\\n\\nCan Saving and Investing Be Done Simultaneously? Absolutely. Advisors recommend that individuals set aside an emergency fund of several months’ worth of expenses in a savings account or similarly liquid option before considering whether to invest additional funds. Further, you may consider saving for some types of financial goals while you also invest in an effort to achieve other goals.\\n\\nThe Bottom Line\\n\\nSaving and investing are sometimes used interchangeably, but they represent different ways of using your money. Saving refers to holding your funds in a low-risk, low-return savings account, CD, or money market account, while investing refers to buying and selling stocks, bonds, ETFs, mutual funds, commodities, and/or real estate.\\n\\nSaving is generally seen as preferable for investors with short-term financial goals, a low risk tolerance, or those in need of an emergency fund. Investing may be the best option for people who already have a rainy-day fund and are focused on longer-term financial goals or those who have a higher risk tolerance.')),\n",

It's also the amount you are paid over time when you deposit money in a savings account or certificate of deposit. You are essentially loaning money to the bank, and it is paying you interest.\\n\\nThe interest rate is a percentage of the loan amount, such as 4%.\\n\\nBut the percentage paid can be radically different in real dollar terms depending on whether it is calculated as simple interest or compound interest:\\n\\nSimple interest is the percentage of a loan amount that will be paid by the borrower annually in addition to paying the loan principal.\\n\\nCompound interest may be the same percentage rate, but it is calculated periodically. Every time it is calculated, the new interest payment is added to the principal amount, thus increasing the dollar amount due every time it is calculated. In other words, your interest is earning interest.\\n\\nKey Takeaways Interest is the cost of borrowing money, expressed as a percentage of the total amount of the loan.\\n\\nSimple interest is an annual percentage of the amount borrowed, referred to as the annual interest rate.\\n\\nCompound interest is based on the sum of the principal amount and the previous interest payments on it.\\n\\nSo, if interest on an account is compounded daily, the interest paid is higher by a fractional amount every day.\\n\\nSimple Interest\\n\\nSimple interest is the annual percentage of a loan amount that must be paid to the lender in addition to the principal amount of the loan. The total dollar amount of interest is determined by the length of time it takes for the loan to be repaid.\\n\\nSimple interest is calculated using the following formula:\\n\\nSimple Interest = P × r × n where: P = Principal amount r = Annual interest rate n = Term of loan, in years \\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\text{Simple Interest} = P \\\\times r \\\\times n \\\\\\\\ &\\\\textbf{where:} \\\\\\\\ &P = \\\\text{Principal amount} \\\\\\\\ &r = \\\\text{Annual interest rate} \\\\\\\\ &n = \\\\text{Term of loan, in years} \\\\\\\\ \\\\end{aligned} \\u200bSimple Interest=P×r×nwhere:P=Principal amountr=Annual interest raten=Term of loan, in years\\u200b\\n\\nTo find simple interest, multiply the original borrowed (principal amount) by the interest rate (annual interest rate), written as a decimal instead of a percentage. To change a percentage into a decimal, divide the amount by 100 or move the decimal point in the percentage figure two places to the left—for example, 5% can be changed to .05.\\n\\nThen, multiply that number by how long you'll leave the money in the account or the loan time (term of the loan in years).\\n\\nSimple Interest Example\\n\\n\\n\\nLet's say a student gets a loan to pay for one year of college tuition. The original amount is $18,000. The loan's annual interest rate is 6%. The student gets a great job after graduation, cuts spending, and repays the loan over three years. How much interest will the student pay in total?\\n\\nTo find the answer, multiply the original amount borrowed ($18,000) by the interest rate (6% becomes .06). This amount is $1,080. The student will pay $1,080 per year in interest.\\n\\nThen multiply that number by the loan term, or years of repayment, which is three years. This amount is $3,240. The student will repay $3,240 over that time.\\n\\nSo the quick formula to find the simple interest the student will pay is:\\n\\n$ 3 , 240 = $ 18 , 000 × 0.06 × 3 \\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\$3,240 = \\\\$18,000 \\\\times 0.06 \\\\times 3 \\\\\\\\ \\\\end{aligned} \\u200b$3,240=$18,000×0.06×3\\u200b\\n\\nHow much will the student pay back in total, including the principal and all interest payments? Add the principal amount ($18,000) plus simple interest ($3,240) to find this. The student will repay $21,240 in total to borrow money for college.\\n\\n$ 21 , 240 = $ 18 , 000 + $ 3 , 240 \\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\$21,240 = \\\\$18,000 + \\\\$3,240 \\\\\\\\ \\\\end{aligned} \\u200b$21,240=$18,000+$3,240\\u200b\\n\\nCompound Interest\\n\\nCompound interest is more complicated. Unlike simple interest, compound interest accrues or builds over time. You earn interest on the principal plus any interest that was paid previously.\\n\\nIf you're borrowing money with compound interest, this means you'll pay interest on the principal plus any interest that has built up. If you're depositing money in the bank, it means the interest payment on your money will grow over time in real dollar terms.\\n\\nInterest may be compounded daily, monthly, quarterly, semiannually, or annually. The more often it's compounded, the more you earn or pay.\\n\\nThe formula for compound interest is:\\n\\n\\n\\nCompound Interest = P × ( 1 + r ) t − P where: P = Principal amount r = Annual interest rate t = Number of years interest is applied \\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\text{Compound Interest} = P \\\\times \\\\left ( 1 + r \\\\right )^t - P \\\\\\\\ &\\\\textbf{where:} \\\\\\\\ &P = \\\\text{Principal amount} \\\\\\\\ &r = \\\\text{Annual interest rate} \\\\\\\\ &t = \\\\text{Number of years interest is applied} \\\\\\\\ \\\\end{aligned} \\u200bCompound Interest=P×(1+r)t−Pwhere:P=Principal amountr=Annual interest ratet=Number of years interest is applied\\u200b\\n\\n\\n\\nCompound Interest Example\\n\\nImagine you have an interest rate of 10%, a principal amount of $100, and a period of two years.\\n\\nUse the formula to calculate the total amount you'll pay back or earn in interest:\\n\\nP = $100\\n\\nr = 10% or 0.10\\n\\nt = 2\\n\\n$100 x (1 + 0.10) 2 - $100\\n\\n- $100 $100 x (1.10) 2 - $100\\n\\n- $100 $100 x 1.21 - $100\\n\\n$121 - $100 = $21\\n\\n\\n\\nIt might be easier to use an online calculator, but it's good to understand how the formula works.\\n\\nMore Simple Interest vs. Compound Interest Examples\\n\\nBelow are some examples of simple and compound interest.\\n\\nExample 1: Simple Interest\\n\\nSuppose you put $5,000 into a 1-year certificate of deposit (CD). The CD pays simple interest at 3% per year. The interest you earn after one year is $150:\\n\\n$ 5 , 000 × 3 % × 1 \\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\$5,000 \\\\times 3\\\\% \\\\times 1 \\\\\\\\ \\\\end{aligned} \\u200b$5,000×3%×1\\u200b\\n\\nExample 2: Simple Interest\\n\\nSuppose you don't want to get a 1-year CD but a 4-month CD.\\n\\nIf you cash the CD after four months, how much would you earn in interest if the interest rates are based on an annual rate?\\n\\nYou would receive $50. You multiply the principal ($5,000) by the annual interest rate (3% or 0.03) by the months the CD was active (4 out of 12 months).\\n\\n$ 5 , 000 × 3 % × 4 12 \\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\$5,000 \\\\times 3\\\\% \\\\times \\\\frac{ 4 }{ 12 } \\\\\\\\ \\\\end{aligned} \\u200b$5,000×3%×124\\u200b\\u200b\\n\\nExample 3: Simple Interest\\n\\nSuppose you want to start a business after college by creating a cool new app. To fund all the costs involved, you borrow $500,000 for three years from a wealthy aunt, paying 5% simple interest. You plan to repay the loan in three years in one lump sum, with profits you make after someone buys your business.\\n\\nHow much would you have to pay in interest charges every year in the meantime? You have to pay $25,000 in interest charges every year, using the below formula:\\n\\n$ 500 , 000 × 5 % × 1 \\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\$500,000 \\\\times 5\\\\% \\\\times 1 \\\\\\\\ \\\\end{aligned} \\u200b$500,000×5%×1\\u200b\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat would your total interest charges be after three years? You would pay $75,000 in total interest charges after three years, using the below formula:\\n\\n$ 25 , 000 × 3 \\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\$25,000 \\\\times 3 \\\\\\\\ \\\\end{aligned} \\u200b$25,000×3\\u200b\\n\\nExample 4: Compound Interest\\n\\nContinuing with the above example, suppose you can't find a buyer but still believe in the company. You determine you need to borrow an additional $500,000 for three more years. Unfortunately, your rich aunt is tapped out but has granted you an extension on repaying her.\\n\\nSo, you apply to a bank for a loan at an interest rate of 5% per year. But this time, the interest is compounded annually. The entire loan amount and interest are payable after three years. What would be the total interest you pay?\\n\\nSince compound interest is calculated on the principal and accumulated interest, here's how it adds up:\\n\\nAfter Year One, Interest Payable = $ 25 , 000 , or $ 500 , 000 (Loan Principal) × 5 % × 1 After Year Two, Interest Payable = $ 26 , 250 , or $ 525 , 000 (Loan Principal + Year One Interest) × 5 % × 1 After Year Three, Interest Payable = $ 27 , 562.50 , or $ 551 , 250 Loan Principal + Interest for Years One and Two) × 5 % × 1 Total Interest Payable After Three Years = $ 78 , 812.50 , or $ 25 , 000 + $ 26 , 250 + $ 27 , 562.50 \\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\text{After Year One, Interest Payable} = \\\\$25,000 \\\\text{,} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{or } \\\\$500,000 \\\\text{ (Loan Principal)} \\\\times 5\\\\% \\\\times 1 \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{After Year Two, Interest Payable} = \\\\$26,250 \\\\text{,} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{or } \\\\$525,000 \\\\text{ (Loan Principal + Year One Interest)} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\times 5\\\\% \\\\times 1 \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{After Year Three, Interest Payable} = \\\\$27,562.50 \\\\text{,} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{or } \\\\$551,250 \\\\text{ Loan Principal + Interest for Years One} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{and Two)} \\\\times 5\\\\% \\\\times 1 \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{Total Interest Payable After Three Years} = \\\\$78,812.50 \\\\text{,} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{or } \\\\$25,000 + \\\\$26,250 + \\\\$27,562.50 \\\\\\\\ \\\\end{aligned} \\u200bAfter Year One, Interest Payable=$25,000,or $500,000 (Loan Principal)×5%×1After Year Two, Interest Payable=$26,250,or $525,000 (Loan Principal + Year One Interest)×5%×1After Year Three, Interest Payable=$27,562.50,or $551,250 Loan Principal + Interest for Years Oneand Two)×5%×1Total Interest Payable After Three Years=$78,812.50,or $25,000+$26,250+$27,562.50\\u200b\\n\\nYou can also calculate your total interest using the compound interest formula from above:\\n\\nTotal Interest Payable After Three Years = $ 78 , 812.50 , or $ 500 , 000 (Loan Principal) × ( 1 + 0.05 ) 3 − $ 500 , 000 \\\\begin{aligned} &\\\\text{Total Interest Payable After Three Years} = \\\\$78,812.50 \\\\text{,} \\\\\\\\ &\\\\text{or } \\\\$500,000 \\\\text{ (Loan Principal)} \\\\times (1 + 0.05)^3 - \\\\$500,000 \\\\\\\\ \\\\end{aligned} \\u200bTotal Interest Payable After Three Years=$78,812.50,or $500,000 (Loan Principal)×(1+0.05)3−$500,000\\u200b\\n\\nThis shows how compound interest quickly adds up when borrowing—and how carefully you should consider big loans that you pay back over a long time.\\n\\nWhich Is Better, Simple or Compound Interest? It depends on whether you're saving or borrowing. Compound interest is better for you if you're saving money in a bank account or being repaid for a loan. If you're borrowing money, you'll pay less over time with simple interest. Simple interest really is simple to calculate. If you want to know how much simple interest you'll pay on a loan over a given time frame, simply sum those payments to arrive at your cumulative interest.\\n\\nHow Do Teens Benefit From Compound Interest? Teens have the advantage of youth and time. The earlier you start saving money, the more money you earn in interest. If it is compound interest, your interest earns interest, meaning you're earning more every time interest is paid. Keep adding to your savings to increase your earnings even more.\\n\\nWhat is the Rule of 72? The Rule of 72 helps you estimate how long it will take your investment to double if you have a fixed annual interest rate. Divide the number 72 by your investment’s interest rate. For example, if your interest rate is 4%, divide 72 by 4. You get 18. It will take roughly 18 years for your investment to double in value.

Those assets can include cash, stocks, bonds, and other investments, as well as real estate and family businesses. In recent years, generational wealth has become a focal point in discussions about the racial wealth gap and the increasing concentration of wealth in the U.S. because it plays a substantial role in both.\\n\\nKey Takeaways Generational wealth refers to assets passed from one generation of a family to the next.\\n\\nIn some cases, assets are transferred after death in the form of an inheritance. In others, they are passed to the next generation while the giver is still alive.\\n\\nGenerational wealth contributes to both the wealth gap between rich and poor in the U.S. and the wealth gap among races.\\n\\nGenerational Wealth Transfers After Death\\n\\nThe bulk of generational wealth is passed down at death as an inheritance. For most American families, inheritances are relatively modest. Between 1995 and 2016, for example, more than 55% of inheritances were under $50,000. At the other end of the wealth spectrum, only 2% of inheritances exceeded $1 million. While small in number, however, 2% of inheritances accounted for more than 40% of all the money that was passed down; the 55% majority’s share added up to less than 6%.\\n\\nThe federal government taxes inheritances above a certain amount in the form of an estate tax. In addition, some states also levy an estate tax or an inheritance tax. An estate tax is paid by the estate, while an inheritance tax is borne by the individual heirs.\\n\\nMost inheritances in the U.S. fall below the threshold for incurring federal estate taxes, which is $13.61 million for 2024. The federal government does not impose an inheritance tax.\\n\\nState estate and inheritance taxes also affect very few families. To begin with, only 12 states plus the District of Columbia have an estate tax. The states are Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington. All of them exempt at least the first $1 million in assets, and some set the exemption considerably higher.\\n\\nSeventeen states and the District of Columbia have inheritance or estate taxes; only Maryland has both. Those taxes can vary by income level and the heir’s relationship to the deceased. Money passed from spouse to spouse is not taxed. Wealthy families have ways to lessen the burden of estate or inheritance taxes, through trusts and other legal means.\\n\\nGenerational Wealth Transfers During Life\\n\\nA generation doesn’t always have to die off in order to enrich its heirs. Families can transfer much of their wealth in other ways. These include:\\n\\nGifts\\n\\nIn 2024, families can pass along $18,000 per person, or $36,000 per couple, in money or property without incurring federal gift taxes. For example, a couple with four children could give the kids $144,000 tax-free in 2024 and continue their gifts in future years.\\n\\nA common intergenerational gift, even among families of moderate means, is helping with the down payment on a younger person’s first home.\\n\\nEducational Expenses\\n\\nMoney that one generation pays for another’s education is also a common way wealth is transferred. By paying tuition directly to the educational institution, one is exempt from gift taxes. Room and board, books, and other expenses are not exempt.\\n\\nMedical Expenses\\n\\nAs with tuition, eligible medical expenses paid directly to the provider are excluded from gift taxes.\\n\\nGenerational Wealth and the Wealth Gap\\n\\nIn the United States, a survey from the Federal Reserve shows that the top 10% of the population holds 74% of the country’s wealth, while the bottom 50% holds just 2%. A major reason for that disparity is the transfer of wealth from generation to generation.\\n\\nA 2018 analysis by the Federal Reserve reported that “the bulk of intergenerational transfers are flowing to families that already have substantial resources.” It found that nearly 40% of intergenerational transfers went to households in the top 10% of the population in terms of income, while only about 20% went to families in the bottom 50%.\\n\\nFurthermore, more than 50% of intergenerational transfers went to the top 10% in terms of wealth, while only 8% went to the bottom 50%. The Federal Reserve estimates that 72% of the wealth held by the wealthiest 10% can be attributed to intergenerational transfers.\\n\\nOther types of intergenerational wealth transfers may come into play here. For example, education is highly correlated with greater earning power and wealth. Thus, a family that can afford to pay for the next generation’s college education is giving them an edge in accumulating more wealth of their own.\\n\\nNote The Great Gatsby Curve illustrates the relationship between income inequality in a country and the potential for its citizens to achieve upward mobility. Graphs that depict these two variables suggest a strong positive correlation between inequality and a lack of upward advancement from one generation to the next.\\n\\nGenerational Wealth and the Racial Wealth Gap\\n\\nThe 2022 Survey of Consumer Finances by the Federal Reserve documents racial disparities in financial well-being in the country. According to the report, the average White family had approximately six times as much wealth as the average Black family and five times the average Hispanic family.\\n\\nThe median wealth for White families in 2022 was $287,000. For Black families, it was $45,000. For Hispanic families, it was $61,000. According to the St. Louis Fed, the large gap between White and Black families is a result of historical practices and policies that \"systematically stripped wealth from Black families and facilitated wealth building among White families.\"\\n\\nThe report goes on to specifically state that \"because of continued barriers and the intergenerational nature of wealth, it is very difficult for individuals or families to overcome the gaps.\"\\n\\nHow Do You Build Generational Wealth? Generational wealth can take many forms, but it is often built through investing in stocks and bonds, owning real estate, starting a business, or a combination of all of those. Smart estate planning can also help make sure that generational wealth isn\\'t diminished through taxes that would otherwise be avoidable.\\n\\nWhat Is Considered a Gift for Tax Purposes? The Internal Revenue Service defines gifts as \"Any transfer to an individual, either directly or indirectly, where full consideration (measured in money or money\\'s worth) is not received in return.\"\\n\\nHow Much Is the Federal Estate Tax? Currently, the federal estate tax ranges from 18% to 40% of the taxable amount—in other words, the amount that exceeds the exemption.\\n\\nThe Bottom Line\\n\\nAmerican families can pass wealth from one generation to the next through inheritances and other means, often with no tax implications. Critics maintain that the transfer of generational wealth exacerbates inequality in the U.S., creating both a gap between wealthy Americans and the rest of the population and between White Americans and members of racial minority groups.')),\n",

Even those who fall under these minimums may still need to file, especially if they want to get a tax refund.\\n\\nBut missing a tax filing deadline or failing to pay your tax bill in full can have serious consequences. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) recommends filing past-due tax returns as soon as possible to limit penalties and interest on the amount you owe.\\n\\nKey Takeaways Missing a tax filing deadline or failing to pay your taxes can have serious consequences.\\n\\nTaxpayers who owe back taxes should file a past-due return as soon as possible.\\n\\nYou can request copies of your tax transcripts to help you prepare your outstanding returns.\\n\\nThe IRS charges interest and penalties on back taxes and may take severe collection actions against taxpayers who fail to pay.\\n\\nTaxpayers who cannot afford to pay back taxes may request a payment plan or apply for an offer in compromise with the IRS.\\n\\nWhat Are Back Taxes?\\n\\nBack taxes refer to an outstanding federal or state tax liability from a prior year. Federal income tax returns are typically due each year on April 15 for the prior year. You may request an extension to file your taxes, which gives you another six months to file your return; however, even if your extension is approved, you must still pay your tax bill by the required due date. This is generally on April 15 for most individual tax filers.\\n\\nHow to File Back Taxes\\n\\nIf you owe back taxes, you must file a past-due return with the IRS. Although the process is similar to filing an on-time tax return, there are a few things to keep in mind.\\n\\nTo start, you’ll need to locate your tax forms and other financial documents. A past-due tax return requires the same information as a regular tax return. Make sure you have any W-2s and 1099s you received during the year in which your back taxes were due. You’ll also want to gather any receipts necessary for claiming income tax deductions or credits.\\n\\nIf you don’t have all of your documents or aren’t sure if you do, you can request a tax return transcript from the IRS. You may elect to receive your transcript electronically or by mail. Transcripts are generally only available for the current tax year and each of the last three tax years, but taxpayers may request a transcript from an older tax year by submitting Form 4506-T.\\n\\nIf you need help completing your past-due return, you can use tax preparation software or hire a professional.\\n\\nTax forms are often updated due to legislation changes. When filing back taxes, make sure you use the original tax forms and instructions for the year you file. The IRS provides a database of prior-year forms on its website.\\n\\nUnlike a regular tax return, you cannot e-file a past-due return. You must send your late return along with your payment to the mailing address listed on Form 1040, or on a late notice from the IRS if you received one. Be sure to include any taxes owed from prior tax years with your payment. Your unpaid balance will continue to accrue interest until it is paid in full.\\n\\nWhat Happens If I Don’t File Back Taxes?\\n\\nIf you have back taxes, it’s important to file a past-due tax return as soon as possible. If you don’t file or pay your taxes in full by the deadline, the IRS will begin to charge penalties on the amount you owe. Types of penalties include:\\n\\nFailure-to-File Penalty: If you miss your filing deadline and have not filed an extension, the IRS imposes a penalty of 5% of the amount of your unpaid taxes. The IRS will continue to charge an additional 5% every month for up to five months up to a maximum of 25%. There is also an additional late filing penalty for returns that are filed more than 60 days after their due date. Your penalty is equal to the full amount of your overdue tax bill, or $485, whichever is less.\\n\\nIf you miss your filing deadline and have not filed an extension, the IRS imposes a penalty of 5% of the amount of your unpaid taxes. The IRS will continue to charge an additional 5% every month for up to five months up to a maximum of 25%. There is also an additional late filing penalty for returns that are filed more than 60 days after their due date. Your penalty is equal to the full amount of your overdue tax bill, or $485, whichever is less. Failure-to-Pay Penalty: If you don’t pay your taxes by the deadline, the IRS will charge a 0.5% penalty for each month that your payment is late. The maximum failure-to-pay penalty is 25%. Keep in mind, though, that interest will accrue until your tax liability is paid in full.\\n\\nThere is also a penalty for underpaying estimated taxes, which are typically due on April 15, June 15, Sept. 15, and Jan. 15. For the second quarter of 2024, the penalty for underpayments is 8%.\\n\\nIn addition to interest and penalties, other inconveniences can result from not filing and paying your taxes. For example:\\n\\nThe IRS will not issue refunds to taxpayers who are past due.\\n\\nYou may have trouble getting a mortgage, federal financial aid, or other loans.\\n\\nYou will not receive credits toward Social Security benefits for self-employment income.\\n\\nThe IRS may file a substitute return for you, which may not include all of the credits and deductions for which you qualify.\\n\\nThe IRS may begin collections, which could include a levy on your bank account or paycheck or a federal tax lien on your property.\\n\\nYou may be subject to additional enforcement penalties or criminal charges.\\n\\nThe IRS generally has 10 years to collect back taxes, after which the amount is usually wiped clean from a taxpayer's history and the IRS writes it off.\\n\\nWhat If I Can’t Afford to Pay Back Taxes?\\n\\nThe IRS offers several options to assist taxpayers who cannot pay their tax liability; however, if you owe back taxes, it’s up to you to contact the IRS for assistance. If you do nothing, the IRS will continue to charge interest on your unpaid taxes.\\n\\nSome options for individuals who can’t afford tax payments include:\\n\\nRequest to delay collections\\n\\nPropose an offer in compromise\\n\\nApply for reasonable-cause assistance\\n\\nApply for penalty abatement relief\\n\\nRequest an installment agreement\\n\\nIn some cases, you may need professional help preparing an offer in compromise or other solutions for your unpaid tax liability. Try to avoid tax settlement firms that claim to offer an easy solution to reduce your debt. These companies often charge high fees and make promises that are nearly impossible to keep.\\n\\nTaxpayers in this situation should contact a qualified tax attorney who can evaluate their situation and provide a recommendation. The key is to get help as soon as possible to limit penalty charges and accruing interest. Ideally, this is before you receive notice from the IRS. The IRS has a directory of approved federal tax preparers that includes attorneys. It also offers Low-Income Taxpayer Clinics to help in this situation.\\n\\nWhat Happens If You Have Back Taxes? If you have back taxes, the IRS will aim to collect them. In addition to being charged penalties and fees, the IRS may seize your assets, such as homes, cars, wages, bank accounts, and Social Security benefits.\\n\\nAre Back Taxes Ever Forgiven? Back taxes are not forgiven per se. The IRS has 10 years to collect unpaid tax debt after which it writes it off and the amount is removed from a taxpayer's history.\\n\\nWhat If I Owe the IRS and Can't Pay? If you owe money to the IRS and can't pay, it is best to contact the IRS to work out a payment plan rather than ignoring the situation. You may be able to work out a payment plan with the IRS.\\n\\nThe Bottom Line\\n\\nBack taxes are taxes owed from a prior year. If you owe back taxes, you'll have to file a past-due return with the IRS. If you do not pay your back taxes, you will consistently incur penalties and fees on the outstanding amount. In addition, there are other adverse consequences, such as the inability to obtain a mortgage, collections being brought against you, and criminal charges. If you do owe back taxes, contact the IRS and determine a plan to pay your outstanding amount.\")),\n",

For example, Google\\'s digital wallet service allows you to add funds to the wallet on your phone or device.\\n\\nApple, on the other hand, entered into a strategic partnership with Goldman Sachs to issue Apple credit cards and expand its Apple Pay services.\\n\\nAge Requirements for Using a Digital Wallet\\n\\nMost makers of digital wallets place age restrictions on young users. For example, if you\\'re not yet 18, you can\\'t open your own Apple Pay account; however, Apple does offer \"Apple Cash Family,\" where children or teens as part of a family can send or receive money with Messages and Wallet and make purchases with Apple Pay. Parents would need to create and authorize this from their own accounts.\\n\\nCash App segregates the types of services available to those 18 and younger. For example, if you are below 18, you can pay someone else or receive funds—up to $1,000 every 30 days, in peer-to-peer transactions. Borrowing, check deposits, cross-border payments, and phone support are available only to those 18 and older.\\n\\nPros and Cons of Digital Wallets\\n\\nPros\\n\\nLimits exposure for financial and personal information : Having a digital wallet adds security for your credit cards and identification.\\n\\n: Having a digital wallet adds security for your credit cards and identification. Ends carrying a physical wallet and cards : Possessing forms of payment and ID in your mobile device means you can carry less, avoiding the chance of losing those items.\\n\\n: Possessing forms of payment and ID in your mobile device means you can carry less, avoiding the chance of losing those items. Can improve financial services access: The availability of digital wallets gives people in underserved areas more options for payment and commerce.\\n\\n\\n\\nCons\\n\\nMay not be accepted everywhere : Smaller shops or less-developed areas may not be set up to accept payment via a digital wallet.\\n\\n: Smaller shops or less-developed areas may not be set up to accept payment via a digital wallet. May not work if Bluetooth or WiFi isn\\'t available : If an Internet setup or electronic point-of-sale network isn\\'t functioning, it may not be possible to pay using a digital wallet.\\n\\n: If an Internet setup or electronic point-of-sale network isn\\'t functioning, it may not be possible to pay using a digital wallet. Vulnerable to identify theft or fraud: If your mobile device is stolen and isn\\'t protected by a password or biometric data, or if your digital wallet is hacked, you could suffer criminal use of the information.\\n\\nPros Limits exposure of financial and personal information\\n\\nEnds carrying a physical wallet and cards\\n\\nCan improve access to financial services in underserved areas Cons Payment method may not be accepted everywhere\\n\\nMay not work if Bluetooth or WiFi isn\\'t available or your device isn\\'t charged\\n\\nCan be vulnerable to identity theft or fraud if your mobile device is stolen while unprotected, or hacked\\n\\nDigital wallets don\\'t require a bank account at a bank with a physical branch. Instead, you can place your funds in an online-only bank—which gives unbanked and underbanked communities access to financial services, enabling broader financial inclusion.\\n\\nSecurity might become an issue if you use a digital wallet from a provider that hasn\\'t been vetted or doesn\\'t have an established reputation. If your phone isn\\'t password-protected, you risk giving someone else access to your finances if you lose your phone. Additionally, there might be local businesses you prefer to shop at that don\\'t yet have a point of sale that accepts this technology.\\n\\nWhat Is a Digital Wallet Example? Apple Pay is an example of one of the more well-known digital wallets. It allows you to access your financial products through your devices and to make purchases.\\n\\nIs PayPal a Digital Wallet? PayPal is a peer-to-peer payment and money exchange platform, but it has a digital wallet included in its app.\\n\\nDo I Need a Digital Wallet? You don\\'t necessarily need a digital wallet. However, they offer a convenient way to pay for your purchases because you don\\'t have to carry credit and debit cards around; that information is instead stored in the cloud. This also increases card security—you can\\'t lose your cards if you don\\'t carry them.\\n\\nThe Bottom Line\\n\\nA digital wallet is a type of financial transaction app that runs on any connected device. It securely stores your payment information and passwords. Mobile wallets are a form of digital wallet most often used on mobile devices.\\n\\nOne of the biggest advantages of digital wallets is that they let you pay for things without credit or debit cards, once you enter and store your card and banking information in the mobile payment platform.')),\n",

Digital currencies have quickly risen to prominence in the portfolios of many retail and institutional investors. At the same time, analysts have continued to caution investors about the volatile nature and unpredictability of cryptocurrencies.\\n\\nIf you’ve decided to invest in the cryptocurrency market, it’s important, as with any other investment, to do your research. Below, we’ll explore what you should know before you invest.\\n\\nKey Takeaways When it comes to cryptocurrencies, one of the biggest challenges for investors is not getting caught up in the hype.\\n\\nTake time to learn about the different currencies offered and research blockchain technology like consensus mechanisms.\\n\\nUnderstanding the differences between a hot and cold wallet; consider investing in both.\\n\\nThere are many primers on blockchain technology that are written for the layperson in addition to technical white papers.\\n\\nPerform test transactions as you begin moving money around networks to ensure your transfers are successful.\\n\\n\\n\\nConsider Why You Are Investing in Cryptocurrency\\n\\nPerhaps the most fundamental question you should ask yourself before making a cryptocurrency investment is why you’re doing it. There are myriad investment vehicles available, many of which offer greater stability and less risk than digital currencies.\\n\\nAre you interested simply because of cryptocurrency’s trendiness? Or is there a more compelling reason for an investment in one or more specific digital tokens? Of course, different investors have various personal investment goals, and exploring the cryptocurrency space may make more sense for some individuals than for others.\\n\\nBegin by taking a comprehensive approach to evaluate your personal risk appetite, investment goals, and portfolio diversification. You may be interested in cryptocurrency as an alternative asset to what you already hold. You may also be interested in potentially higher returns with the understanding that this reward comes with potentially higher risks.\\n\\nBefore investing in cryptocurrency, gain a personal understanding of what you hope to achieve as this will help set the course for your actions.\\n\\nSecure Your Keys\\n\\nA private key is a secret alphanumeric code that allows a user to access and control their digital assets. In a way, it's basically just the password that grants ownership and control of the funds associated with a specific cryptocurrency address. Anyone who can access the private keys of an address has access to all of the funds in that address. This is why it's essential to keep private keys secure and never share them with anyone.\\n\\nPrivate keys are typically generated by a cryptocurrency wallet, and your keys are automatically generated. It's important to note that if a user loses their private key, they'll lose access to their funds forever. Therefore, it's crucial to keep private keys safe and secure by storing them offline in a cold wallet or using a reputable custodial service.\\n\\nKeeping your cryptocurrency on exchanges is a simple way to keep your cryptocurrency liquid and easy to exchange. However, because exchanges technically have access to your keys in this case, you may be more susceptible to losing your funds should the exchange fail or be hacked. Consider solutions to safely storing your private keys, such as writing them down using old-fashioned paper and pencil.\\n\\n\\n\\nYour keys are a series of words that are virtually impossible for hackers to guess. Never tell anyone your keys, and store them in a safe location.\\n\\nGet a Feel for the Industry\\n\\nInvestors should develop a sense of how the digital currency world works before investing. This is particularly true for those who are new to digital currencies. Take the time to learn about the different currencies offered. With thousands of different coins and tokens available, it’s crucial to look beyond the biggest names like Bitcoin or Ether.\\n\\nIt’s also important to explore blockchain technology to get a sense of how this aspect of the cryptocurrency world works. For example, every blockchain has a consensus protocol to ensure the integrity of the ledger. However, there are different types of consensus protocols. For example, proof-of-work protocols are those that require substantial mining setups to validate transactions. Meanwhile, proof-of-stake protocols reward holders with the highest stakes with validation rewards.\\n\\nUnderstanding different aspects of this may impact your investment. For instance, you may be able to stake your cryptocurrency to generate rewards and increase your holdings. On the other hand, proof-of-stake coins may be inflationary if the rewards given to validators are not closely monitored.\\n\\nYou can earn passive income from cryptocurrency via staking rewards.\\n\\nConsider Hot and Cold Wallets\\n\\nWhen you buy a cryptocurrency, you can store it in a cold wallet or a hot wallet. The main difference between a hot and cold wallet is their level of security and convenience. Hot wallets are convenient for frequent trading and spending of cryptocurrency but are more vulnerable to hacking and theft. Cold wallets are more secure but less convenient for frequent use.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe main difference is the connectivity to the wallet. A hot wallet is connected to the internet and can be accessed easily. Examples of hot wallets include online exchanges, mobile wallets, and software wallets. Though hot wallets are great for ease of transacting, hot wallets are also more vulnerable to hacking and theft. If a hacker gains access to your hot wallet, they can potentially steal all your cryptocurrency holdings.\\n\\nOn the other hand, a cold wallet is not connected to the internet. This type of wallet may be a hardware wallet or paper wallet. Though a cold wallet offers a higher level of security, they are more difficult to use. Though they are not vulnerable to online attacks or hacking attempts, it's harder to buy and sell securities from a cold wallet.\\n\\nAs you embark on your cryptocurrency journey, consider which wallet makes more sense to you. In many cases, investors have both and store more material values or more valuable cryptocurrency via their cold wallet. Then, any balances they may be willing to lose or wish to play with may be kept in the hot wallet.\\n\\n\\n\\nRead Cryptocurrency White Papers\\n\\nMore important than word of mouth, though, are the specifics of a digital currency itself. When you’re considering an investment, take the time to find the project’s white paper. Every cryptocurrency project should have one, and it should be easily accessible (if it’s not, consider that a red flag).\\n\\nRead the white paper carefully; it should tell you everything about what the developers of the project intend for their work, including a time frame, a general overview, and specifics about the project. If the white paper does not contain data and specific details about the project, that is generally seen as a negative. The white paper is a development team’s chance to lay out the who, what, when, and why of their project. If the white paper feels incomplete or misleading, then it might speak to fundamental issues with the project itself.\\n\\nIn addition, developers may issue updates to their white paper, especially as it surrounds their development roadmap. Be wary of projects whose timelines continually shift with minimal progress.\\n\\nPerform Test Transactions\\n\\nCryptocurrency is unlike banks in many aspects. One of the most vital reasons to understand this is should you accidentally send money to the wrong place, it may be impossible (literally) to recover. In some cases, you may lose your money forever.\\n\\nAs you join the cryptocurrency world, understand the importance of test transactions. Test transactions are an essential step when sending cryptocurrency because they allow you to confirm that the transaction will be successful before sending a significant amount of funds. Though they result in higher fees, they very well may be worth preventing a large error.\\n\\nTest transactions involve sending a small amount of cryptocurrency to a test address. It is meant to simulate a real transaction without actually sending funds to another party. This allows you to test the sending and receiving process, confirm that your wallet is working correctly, and ensure that you have the correct address for the recipient. Once the test transaction has successfully been performed, you can copy the same transaction information for larger exchanges.\\n\\nA test transaction should be small, such as $1.00. Once the transaction goes through, you'll know you can send larger amounts.\\n\\nPatience Is Key\\n\\nAfter diligent research, you have likely developed a feel for the cryptocurrency industry and may have determined one or more projects in which to invest. The next step is to time your investment. The digital currency world moves quickly and is known for being highly volatile.\\n\\nRemember that digital currencies are highly speculative. For every overnight Bitcoin millionaire, many other investors have poured money into the virtual token realm only to see that money disappear. Investing in this space means taking a risk. By doing your homework before you invest, you help give yourself the best chance of success.\\n\\nWhat Is Cryptocurrency? Cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that is secured by cryptography, which makes it nearly impossible to counterfeit or double-spend. Many cryptocurrencies are decentralized networks based on blockchain technology—a distributed ledger enforced by a disparate network of computers. A defining feature of cryptocurrencies is that they are generally not issued by any central authority, rendering them theoretically immune to government interference or manipulation.\\n\\nIs Investing In Cryptocurrency a Good Idea? While analysts caution investors about the volatile nature and unpredictability of cryptocurrencies, some investors are willing to take the risk for the potential reward. It’s critical to do your research beforehand to determine if investing in cryptocurrency is right for you.\\n\\nHow Do I Learn More About Crypto I Want To Buy? To learn more about cryptocurrencies, join an online community of cryptocurrency investors and enthusiasts, such as that found on Reddit, to see what the community is discussing. Read the white paper that outlines specific details about the cryptocurrency project that you’re considering. Every project should have an easily accessible white paper—if it’s not, consider that a red flag.\\n\\nThe Bottom Line\\n\\nWhen it comes to cryptocurrencies, one of the biggest challenges for investors is not getting caught up in the hype. Analysts continue to caution investors about the volatile nature and unpredictability of cryptocurrencies. If you’ve decided to invest in the cryptocurrency market, it’s important—same as with any other investment—to do your research. Consider why you’re interested in this particular investment vehicle, and familiarize yourself with cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, to be more fully equipped to determine whether this type of investment opportunity is worthwhile for you.\\n\\n\\n\\nInvesting in cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings (ICOs) is highly risky and speculative, and this article is not a recommendation by Investopedia or the writer to invest in cryptocurrencies or ICOs.

Sandberg, the author of \"Expecting Money: The Essential Financial Plan for New and Growing Families,\" has a background as a budget and debt counselor at the Consumer Credit Counseling Service of San Francisco. This wide-ranging interview dives into the topic of debt, which includes tips and strategies to reduce debt like debt consolidation, working with debt settlement companies, and negotiating with creditors yourself. Sandberg\\'s bottom line is that people get themselves into debt and creditors aren\\'t obligated to help them out but it\\'s in both parties\\' interest to get debts settled and not have them go into collections.\\n\\nKey Takeaways Debt relief or debt settlement is a way to reduce or completely eliminate certain debts.\\n\\nDebt consolidation, by contrast, can make debts easier to pay off but doesn\\'t reduce or eliminate them\\n\\nDebt relief can have a negative effect on a person\\'s credit score.\\n\\nPeople can try to negotiate with their creditors on their own or hire a debt relief company.\\n\\nSome companies that offer debt relief services may be scams, so consumers need to check them out carefully.\\n\\nDefining Debt Relief\\n\\nInvestopedia: What is debt relief, and when does debt relief become an option for someone with debt they can\\'t manage?\\n\\nSandberg: In general, debt relief refers to a reduction or cancellation of a consumer\\'s legitimate financial obligations. To be eligible, the accounts usually are delinquent and/or in collections.\\n\\nInvestopedia: What\\'s the difference between debt consolidation and debt relief?\\n\\nSandberg: Consolidation combines all your debt into one account with one payment. The payments are consolidated, but your debt isn\\'t reduced. There are several ways to consolidate debt. It could be through a nonprofit organization, such as a consumer credit counseling service, where you close your accounts, then make a single payment to the agency, which distributes it to your creditors.\\n\\nYou could also consolidate your debt with a new loan or credit card. With a loan, you take out a fixed sum of money, which is enough to assume the outstanding debts. The advantage is that the interest rate is lower than what it was on the original debts, and the single account is easier to manage than multiple accounts. You\\'re also converting revolving balances into an installment loan, which can help your credit report and credit scores.\\n\\nConsolidating debt is also possible with a balance transfer credit card. As long as you qualify, you can shift balances from other credit cards onto a new card and, in many cases, receive a 0% APR (annual percentage rate) for a fixed number of months. In all these scenarios, you would pay the entire balance owed.\\n\\nDebt relief or settlement, on the other hand, is a process where you would pay less than the amount owed, often in a lump sum.\\n\\nAbout Debt Collectors\\n\\nInvestopedia: What\\'s the best way to handle debt collectors?\\n\\nSandberg: First, with legal knowledge. The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act is very specific about what a debt collector can and can\\'t do.\\n\\nSecond, with personal responsibility. When you take out financial products, you sign an agreement. The lender\\'s role is to lend, the borrower\\'s role is to repay. Do your best to meet your end of the contract. When you do communicate with collectors, stay calm. Be factual. This is business, not personal.\\n\\nImpact of Debt Relief on Credit Scores\\n\\nInvestopedia: How does debt relief impact your credit score or general creditworthiness?\\n\\nSandberg: If you receive formal forgiveness, it usually shows up on your credit report as settled. It\\'s better than not paying at all but still an indication that you did not fulfill your contractual obligation. Delinquencies, charge-offs, and accounts that have been sent to collections show up on a credit report for seven years. These dings will not be purged when you settle the account.\\n\\nInvestopedia: Are there ways to minimize the negative impact of entering a debt relief program?\\n\\nSandberg: If you\\'re going to do it, do it quickly. The longer you delay, the longer you will have to wait before it is removed from your credit report.\\n\\nInvestopedia: How does debt relief compare to bankruptcy?\\n\\nSandberg: A Chapter 7 bankruptcy is a clear indication that you\\'ve wiped out your debts in court. It\\'s usually the worst thing that can happen to credit reports and the scores that are derived from the information on the reports. Evidence of a collection account that you settled while paying your other accounts on time and in full will have much less impact.\\n\\nWhere to Seek Debt Relief\\n\\nInvestopedia: Where should people go to seek debt relief?\\n\\nSandberg: If you want to settle your debts, you can do it without a third-party company. You can negotiate a reduced sum on your own. But if you want to hire, look to debt settlement companies that have excellent reputations.\\n\\nDon\\'t choose a debt settlement company that comes to you without you doing your research. Read other people\\'s experiences with the company. Some have thousands of positive reviews, while others are far less well known or have poor reviews.\\n\\nInvestopedia: What are typical fees charged by debt relief companies?\\n\\nSandberg: Most charge fees as a percentage—usually 15 to 20%—of the amount that was forgiven. If they eliminated $5,000 and charge 20%, your fee would be $1,000.\\n\\nInvestopedia: Who protects consumers from unscrupulous debt relief companies?\\n\\nSandberg: The Federal Trade Commission enforces federal consumer protection laws, including those that prevent fraud, deception, and unfair business practices.\\n\\nImpact of COVID-19 on Debt Relief\\n\\nInvestopedia: How did the pandemic affect the need for debt relief?\\n\\nSandberg: A lot of people fell behind on their consumer debts during COVID because they couldn\\'t work as normal. The good news is that credit card companies stepped up to assist. Almost all provided hardship plans to people who were negatively impacted by COVID, so the accounts remained in good standing even though they were technically behind. This prevented accounts from being routed to collection agencies for nonpayment.\\n\\nInvestopedia: What do you see as the long-term impact of COVID-19 on debt and the need for debt relief?\\n\\nSandberg: COVID showed that credit card companies and other lenders can come together and help people in dire circumstances. Accounts don\\'t always have to go into collections. It would be great to see that flexibility continue.\\n\\nFinal Thoughts\\n\\nInvestopedia: What\\'s your message to people with overwhelming debt?\\n\\nSandberg: Remember that when you borrowed the money, you agreed to repay it as per the contract. A creditor is not required to give you a break, even if you have a great reason for needing it.\\n\\nThat said, all a creditor wants is to be repaid. When an account goes into collections, they lose money. Try to work with a creditor before the debt goes bad.\\n\\nKeep in mind, this originated as an agreement between two parties: the lender and you. They upheld their end of the bargain. They loaned you the money. When you don\\'t uphold your end, you have failed to live up to the agreement you struck with the lender. Yes, things happen beyond your control that are not your fault. Nor are they the fault of the lender. Remember, you are not a victim, and the lender is not the enemy. Borrow with all this in mind, and bargain with all this in mind.\\n\\nInvestopedia: All that said, in your opinion, what\\'s not available in the area of debt relief that should be?\\n\\nSandberg: There should be more encouragement to help people be motivated to pay off their accounts. If they don\\'t get a positive credit-reporting boost, it eliminates much of the motivation.\\n\\nWhat Happens When You Settle Debt? When you settle debt, you will typically pay the creditor a portion of what you owe and they will forgive the rest. You account will likely be reported to the credit bureaus as \"settled\" and your credit score will generally take a hit.\\n\\nWho Qualifies for Debt Settlement? You may qualify for debt settlement if your debt is significant enough that you can\\'t afford to make the payments. Typically, debt settlement is only used for credit card debt.\\n\\nHow Long Do Debt Collections Stay on Your Credit Report? Generally, negative information like debt collection stays on your credit report for up to seven years. A bankruptcy may stay on your credit report up to 10 years.\\n\\nThe Bottom Line\\n\\nTo get debt under control, you can take steps like paying more than the minimum amount each month or using a new loan for debt consolidation. For more extreme debt situations that you cannot pay down, you can turn to debt relief options like debt settlement or filing for bankruptcy. If you are struggling with debt, consider consulting a professional financial advisor or credit counselor who can explain the options for your specific situation.\\n\\n')),\n",

While these two investment vehicles share many similarities, they also have key differences that investors should understand.\\n\\n\"By taking a passive, index-based investment approach, an investor can keep fees low while diversifying the portfolio across industries, sectors, and geographies. This results in the investor approximating “universal ownership”—that is, owning a representative slice of the entire global economy—and positioning herself to benefit from broad economic growth regardless of the fortunes of individual companies,\" David Tenerelli, a certified financial planner at Strategic Financial Planning in Plano, Texas, told us.\\n\\nIndex funds are a broad category that includes both passively managed mutual funds and ETFs. As it happens, the majority of both types of funds are index funds. However, the costs, tax implications, and trading opportunities differ between mutual funds and ETFs. Below, we take you through these differences so you understand these important and, for many, fundamental portfolio investments.\\n\\nKey Takeaways Mutual funds are pooled investments managed by a fund management professionals.\\n\\nExchange-traded funds (ETFs) represent baskets of securities traded on an exchanges like stocks.\\n\\nMutual funds are only priced at the end of the day.\\n\\nGenerally speaking, index ETFs cost less and are more tax-efficient than similar mutual funds.\\n\\nWhat Are Index Funds?\\n\\nPassive investing through index funds has seen tremendous growth in recent years as investors seek low-cost, diversified options to build their portfolios. Index funds track the performance of a specific market index, such as the S&P 500 for large U.S. stocks or the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index for U.S. bonds.\\n\\nThe appeal of index funds lies in their simplicity and cost-effectiveness. \"Because there\\'s no original strategy, not much active management is required and so index funds have a lower cost structure than typical mutual funds,\" said Will Thomas, a certified financial planner at the Liberty Group in Washington, DC. By mirroring an index rather than trying to outperform it, these funds have expenses far lower. This and their generally good performance has led to their growing popularity. As of year-end 2023, index mutual funds and ETFs accounted for 48% of assets in long-term funds, up significantly from 19% at year-end 2010.\\n\\nIndex mutual funds are priced once daily after the market closes, and investors buy or sell shares directly from the fund company. In contrast, Thomas noted, \"Although they also hold a basket of assets, ETFs are more akin to equities than to mutual funds. Listed on market exchanges just like individual stocks, they are highly liquid: They can be bought and sold like stock shares throughout the trading day, with prices fluctuating constantly.\"\\n\\nIndex Mutual Funds\\n\\nIndex mutual funds have revolutionized investing since their introduction in the 1970s, offering a low-cost way for investors to gain broad market exposure. These funds aim to replicate the performance of a specific market index, such as the S&P 500 for large U.S. stocks or the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index for bonds. Here are some of their key features:\\n\\nBroad diversification : Most index funds provide exposure to hundreds or thousands of securities in a single financial product, offering instant diversification.\\n\\n: Most index funds provide exposure to hundreds or thousands of securities in a single financial product, offering instant diversification. Low expenses : With no need for extensive research teams or frequent trading, index funds generally have lower expense ratios than their actively managed counterparts.

Tax efficiency: Lower portfolio turnover in index funds can result in fewer taxable events for investors holding these funds in taxable accounts.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Index funds are a low-cost way to track a specific group of investments, which can be more broadly diversified than individual stocks and simpler to buy than each of the individual holdings within the index,\" said Autumn Knutson, founder and lead financial planner at Styled Wealth and an Investopedia top-100 financial advisor. \"They are very popular for people looking to invest in a group of investments in a simple and cost-effective way.\"\\n\\nThe popularity of index mutual funds has grown significantly over the past decade. As of year-end 2023, index mutual funds held $5.9 trillion in total net assets, representing 30% of long-term mutual fund assets. This growth reflects increasing investor awareness of the impact of fees on long-term returns and skepticism about the ability of active managers to consistently outperform their benchmarks.\\n\\nHowever, index funds are not without risks. They will fall in value when their target index declines, and they may underperform actively managed funds during certain market conditions. In addition, not all indexes are created equal, and some may be more representative of their target market than others.\\n\\nExchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)\\n\\nETFs are funds that trade on stock exchanges, much like individual stocks. They offer investors a way to buy a basket of securities in a single transaction. ETFs can track various assets, including stocks, bonds, commodities, or currencies, and can be both actively and passively managed. They account for about 30% of all trading in the U.S.\\n\\nIn early 2024, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved 11 new spot bitcoin ETFs for trading on American exchanges. In mid-2024, the SEC approved spot ether ETFs for further choices in cryptocurrency ETFs from issuers like VanEck, Grayscale, and Fidelity.\\n\\n\\n\\nHere are some of the essential features of ETFs:\\n\\nIntraday trading : Unlike mutual funds, ETFs can be bought and sold throughout the trading day at market prices.\\n\\n: Unlike mutual funds, ETFs can be bought and sold throughout the trading day at market prices.

Lower minimum investments: Investors can often buy as few as one share.\\n\\n\\n\\nAccording to the widely followed S&P Indices Versus Active (SPIVA) scorecards, about nine out of 10 actively managed funds didn\\'t match the returns of the S&P 500 benchmark in the past 15 years.\\n\\nIndex ETFs\\n\\nIndex ETFs were the first type of ETFs to begin trading in the early 1990s in the U.S. They track the performance of a specific market index and run like index mutual funds but with the added benefits of ETF structures.\\n\\nHere are the essential aspects of index ETFs:\\n\\nPassive management : They aim to replicate the performance of their target index.\\n\\n: They aim to replicate the performance of their target index.

Liquidity: They can be traded throughout the day, potentially offering more liquidity than index mutual funds.\\n\\nIndex ETFs have seen substantial growth, with total net assets reaching $5.4 trillion at year-end 2023, representing a significant part of the ETF market.\\n\\nThe SPDR S&P 500 (SPY), launched in 1993 to track the S&P 500 Index, is the oldest surviving and largest ETF with annual returns of 8.21% since 2000.\\n\\nKey Differences\\n\\nThe significant difference between index funds and ETFs is how you buy shares in them and their flexibility. Index mutual funds can only be bought and sold at the end of the trading day, based on the fund\\'s net asset value (NAV). ETFs trade throughout the day on a stock exchange, just like stocks, and their price fluctuates based on supply and demand.\\n\\nWhat this means is that with index mutual funds, your trades are priced at the end of the day based on the total value of the fund\\'s holdings at that time. But with ETFs, your price reflects real-time supply and demand.\\n\\nThey also differ in cost. There are typically no shareholder transaction costs for mutual funds. Management fees tend to be lower for ETFs.\\n\\nIndex ETFs tend to be more tax-efficient than index mutual funds because of how they are structured. ETFs generally use an \"in-kind\" creation and redemption process, which minimizes capital gains distributions that would otherwise trigger tax events. Meanwhile, mutual funds may generate capital gains when the fund manager has to sell holdings to meet redemptions, potentially leading to a tax liability for investors even if they haven\\'t sold their shares.\\n\\nAnother distinction lies in investment minimums and transaction costs. Index mutual funds often have a minimum investment requirement, which can be a barrier for some investors, though these are typically dropped if you are investing through your paycheck. Index ETFs, meanwhile, typically do not have minimums, as you can purchase as little as one share, making them more accessible. However, while ETFs might offer lower expense ratios than mutual funds, buying and selling them could incur trading fees depending on your brokerage. In contrast, many index mutual funds can be bought directly from the issuer without commissions.\\n\\nLiquidity also distinguishes index funds from ETFs. Since index mutual funds are bought and sold at the end of the trading day, liquidity is not as readily available as with ETFs.\\n\\n\\n\\nKey Differences Between Index Funds and ETFs Index Mutual Funds Trading mechanism: NAV (end of day)\\n\\nMinimum investment: Variable\\n\\nTaxation: May incur capital gains tax\\n\\nFees: Lower expense ratios (average of 0.06% for equity funds in 2023)\\n\\nTrading Flexibility: Limited (end of day)\\n\\n\\n\\nETFs Trading mechanism: Stock exchanges (intraday)\\n\\nMinimum investment: Lower (may include fractional shares)\\n\\nTaxation: More tax-efficient\\n\\nFees: Lower expense ratios (as low as 0.03% for some large funds\\n\\nTrading flexibility: Trade throughout the day\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDo ETFs or Index Funds Have Better Returns? The returns of ETFs and index funds are generally very similar when they track the same index, as both aim to replicate the performance of their benchmark. Any differences in returns are usually minimal and often come down to tracking error, expenses, and how dividends are handled. ETFs might have a slight advantage in that they can be more tax-efficient due to their creation/redemption process, potentially leading to fewer capital gains distributions.\\n\\nAre ETFs or Index Funds Safer? ETFs and index funds can offer similar levels of safety when they track broad market indexes. The key factor is diversification, which both types of funds provide by holding a basket of securities. This spread of investments helps reduce risk compared with owning individual stocks. The safety of any investment depends on the specific assets it holds. A broadly diversified S&P 500 ETF or index fund would generally be considered safer than a narrowly focused sector fund of either type.\\n\\nAre Index Funds Better Than Stocks? Index funds and individual stocks serve different purposes and have distinct risk-return profiles. Index funds offer instant diversification by holding a basket of stocks, which can help reduce risk. They also provide a simple way to match market returns without the need for extensive research or stock-picking skills. For many investors, especially those who don\\'t have the time or expertise to analyze individual companies, index funds can be a better choice. However, individual stocks can offer higher returns for investors willing to take on more risk and do thorough research.\\n\\nThe Bottom Line\\n\\nBoth index mutual funds and ETFs can provide investors with broad, diversified exposure to the stock market, making them good long-term investments suitable for most investors. ETFs may be more accessible and easier to trade for retail investors because they trade like shares of stock on exchanges. They also tend to have lower fees and are more tax-efficient.\\n\\n')),\n",

According to the 2022 Investopedia Financial Literacy Survey, 57% U.S. adults are invested, but just one in three say they have advanced investing knowledge. Getting started can be especially daunting if you are a methodical person who is cautious about commencing such an important undertaking before you have acquired sufficient knowledge, expertise, and confidence.\\n\\nMeanwhile, creating a short list of everything that a beginning investor should know inevitably runs the risk of excluding many vital points. Indeed, successful investors are bound to differ widely on what they would include in their top ten lists if they were pressed to replicate this exercise.\\n\\nThat said, we offer what we hope is a useful checklist to help you get started as a successful investor. We have chosen to emphasize key personal attitudes and overarching strategic frameworks that, in our opinion, will help you to become an intelligent investor.\\n\\nKey Takeaways Have a plan, prioritize saving, and know the power of compounding.\\n\\nUnderstand risk, diversification, and asset allocation.\\n\\nMinimize investment costs.\\n\\nLearn classic strategies, be disciplined, and think like an owner or lender.\\n\\nNever invest in something you do not fully understand.\\n\\nSubscribe Now: Apple Podcasts / Spotify / Google Podcasts / PlayerFM\\n\\n1. Have a Financial Plan\\n\\nThe first step toward becoming a successful investor should be starting with a financial plan—one that includes goals and milestones. These goals and milestones would include setting targets for having specific amounts saved by specific dates.\\n\\nThe goals in question might include, for example, having enough savings to facilitate buying a home, funding your children\\'s education, building an emergency fund, having enough to fund an entrepreneurial venture, or having enough to fund a comfortable retirement.\\n\\nMoreover, while most people think in terms of saving for retirement, an even more desirable goal would be to achieve financial independence at as early an age as possible. A movement devoted to this goal is Financial Independence, Retire Early (FIRE).\\n\\nWhile it is possible to create a solid financial plan on your own, if you are new to the process, you might consider enlisting professional help from someone such as a financial advisor or financial planner, preferably one who is a Certified Financial Planner (CFP®). Finally, do not delay. Seek to have a plan in place as early as possible in your lifetime, and keep it a living document, updated regularly and in light of changed circumstances and goals.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe FIRE Movement The FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early) movement argues for rapid wealth accumulation far in advance of the traditional retirement age to give you more options in life, earlier on.\\n\\n2. Make Saving a Priority\\n\\nBefore you can become an investor, you must have money to invest. For most people, that will require setting aside a portion of each paycheck for savings. If your employer offers a savings plan such as a 401(k), this can be an attractive way to make saving automatic, especially if your employer will match all or part of your own contributions.\\n\\nIn setting up your financial plan, you also might consider other alternatives for making saving automatic, in addition to utilizing employer-sponsored plans. Building wealth typically has aggressive saving at its core, followed by astute investing aimed at making those savings grow.\\n\\nAlso, a key to saving aggressively is living frugally and spending with caution. In this vein, a wise adjunct to your financial plan would be creating a budget, tracking your spending closely, and regularly reviewing whether your outlays are making sense and delivering sufficient value. Various budgeting apps and budgeting software packages are available, or you can choose to create your own spreadsheets.\\n\\n3. Understand the Power of Compounding\\n\\nSaving and investing on a regular, systematic basis and starting this discipline as early as possible in life will allow you to take full advantage of the power of compounding to increase your wealth. The current protracted period of historically low interest rates has diminished the power of compounding to some extent, but it also has made starting early to build savings and wealth more imperative, since it will take interest-bearing and dividend-paying investments longer to double in value than before, all else equal.\\n\\n4. Understand Risk\\n\\nInvestment risk has many aspects, such as default risk on a bond (the risk that the issuer may not meet its obligations to pay interest or repay principal) and volatility in stocks (which can produce sharp, sudden increases or decreases in value). Additionally, there is, in general, a tradeoff between risk and return, or between risk and reward. That is, the route to achieving higher returns on your investments often involves assuming more risk, including the risk of losing all or part of your investment.\\n\\nAs a critical part of your planning process, you should determine your own risk tolerance. How much you can be prepared to lose should a prospective investment decline in value, and how much ongoing price volatility in your investments you can accept without inducing undue worry, will be important considerations in determining what sorts of investments are most appropriate for you.\\n\\nRisk At its most basic level, investment risk includes the possibility of a complete loss. But there are many other aspects to risk and its measurement.\\n\\n5. Understand Diversification and Asset Allocation\\n\\nDiversification and asset allocation are two closely related concepts that play important roles both in managing investment risk and in optimizing investment returns. Broadly speaking, diversification involves spreading your investment portfolio among a variety of investments, in hopes that subpar returns or losses in some may be offset by above average returns or gains in others. Likewise, asset allocation has similar goals, but with the focus being on distributing your portfolio across major categories of investments, such as stocks, bonds, and cash.\\n\\nOnce again, your ongoing financial planning process should revisit your decisions on diversification and asset allocation regularly.\\n\\n6. Keep Costs Low\\n\\nYou cannot control the future returns on your investments, but you can control the costs. Moreover, costs (e.g., transaction costs, investment management fees, account fees, etc.) can be a significant drag on investment performance. Similarly, taking mutual funds as just one example, high cost is no guarantee of better performance.\\n\\nThe Importance of Costs Investment costs and fees are often a key determinant of investment results.\\n\\n7. Understand Classic Investment Strategies\\n\\nAmong the investment strategies that the beginning investor should understand fully are active versus passive investing, value versus growth investing, and income-oriented versus gains-oriented investing.\\n\\nWhile savvy investment managers can beat the market, very few do it consistently over the long term. This leads some investment pundits to recommend low-cost passive investing strategies, mainly those utilizing index funds, that seek to track the market.\\n\\nIn the realm of equity investing, value investors prefer stocks that appear to be relatively inexpensive compared to the market on measures such as price-earnings ratios (P/E), expecting that these stocks have upside potential as well as limited downside risk. Growth investors, by contrast, see greater opportunity for gain among stocks that are recording rapid increases in revenues and earnings, even if they are relatively expensive.\\n\\nIncome-oriented investors seek a steady stream of dividends and interest because they need the ongoing spendable cash, they see this as a strategy that limits investment risk, or both. Among the variations of income-oriented investing is focusing on stocks that offer dividend growth.\\n\\nGains-oriented investors are largely unconcerned about income streams from their investments and instead look for the investments that seem likely to deliver the most price appreciation in the long term.\\n\\nRead about Investopedia\\'s 10 Rules of Investing by picking up a copy of our special issue print edition.\\n\\n8. Be Disciplined\\n\\nIf you are investing for the long term, according to a well-thought and well-constructed financial plan, stay disciplined. Try not to get excited or rattled by temporary market fluctuations and panic-inducing media coverage of the markets that might border on the sensationalistic. Also, always take the pronouncements of market pundits with a grain of salt unless they have lengthy, independently verified track records of predictive accuracy. Few do.\\n\\n9. Think Like an Owner or Lender\\n\\nStocks are shares of ownership in a business enterprise. Bonds represent loans extended by the investor to the issuer. If you intend to be an intelligent long-term investor rather than a short-term speculator, think like a prospective business owner before you buy a stock, or like a prospective lender before you buy a bond. Do you want to be a part owner of that business, or a creditor of that issuer?\\n\\n10. If You Don’t Understand It, Don’t Invest in It\\n\\nGiven the proliferation of complex and novel investment products, as well as of companies with complex and novel business models, beginning investors today are faced with a vast array of investment choice that they may not fully understand. A simple and wise rule of thumb is never to make an investment that you do not fully understand, particularly when it comes to its risks. A corollary is to be very careful about avoiding investing fads, many of which may not stand the test of time.\\n\\nAvoid the Unknown Avoid investments you don\\'t fully understand. They may present large hidden dangers.\\n\\nWhat Do I Need to Know Before Investing? Before investing, it is critical to know what your goals and objectives are. Whether it be to fund retirement, purchase a home, or undertake a new business venture, knowing what you\\'re working towards will help you choose an investment to help you meet your goals. It is also important to know the basics about investing—such as risks, fees and costs, and investment strategies—and understand the investment you\\'re prospecting.\\n\\nWhat Are the 4 Main Types of Investments? While there are many investment categories, the four basic types are stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Stocks are shares of ownership in a company. Bonds are essentially loans made by the investor to the issuer, who promises to pay the principal at maturity and interest over the bond\\'s term. Mutual funds are funds in which multiple investors pool their money together to purchase stocks or other securities, and ETFs are like mutual funds but are traded on national stock exchanges.\\n\\nIs $100 Enough to Start Investing? Many prospective investors believe they must have a lot of money to begin investing. However, many investments have low thresholds, giving new investors opportunities to start their journey. You can begin investing with $100 or less. For instance, you could purchase shares or fractional shares of stock, use a robo-advisor to invest based on your goals, contribute to a retirement plan, or invest in a mutual fund. The options are plenty.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Bottom Line\\n\\nAs a new investor, choosing the right investments or investment strategy can be intimidating, and the advice on how to proceed is as diverse as the selection of investments from which to choose. Despite the innumerous recommendations, building your knowledge and having a solid understanding of investing and your goals is key to making informed decisions that will likely yield favorable results.\\n\\n\\n\\nAddendum: A Classic Reading\\n\\nIf there is one book you should read as a new investor, it is Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds by Charles Mackay. Written in 1841 by a Scottish journalist, it is a masterful early study of crowd psychology. The first three chapters, \"The Mississippi Scheme,\" \"The South-Sea Bubble,\" and \"The Tulipomania,\" all deal with financial crazes that ended up in disaster and that foreshadow many financial schemes, bubbles, and manias of today. As a result, these chapters have been cited by a number of present-day financial writers.\\n\\n')),\n",

Even when money is tight, you can find ways to start setting aside small amounts and investing them, taking advantage of compound interest over the course of your lifetime.\\n\\nThe beauty of investing is that unlike purchasing a car or even a home, it doesn't require a significant down payment. But the cost of living, as well as unplanned expenses, can make anyone feel that saving to invest is an uphill battle.\\n\\nIf you're living on a tight budget, though, it's possible to start investing small amounts and letting them add up over time. Here are some thoughtful ways to put away extra cash without breaking the bank, which will provide you with the means to start investing.\\n\\nKey Takeaways Investing is possible even when money is tight, and saving small amounts now lets you take advantage of years of compound interest.\\n\\nA high-yield savings account can help you start building wealth.\\n\\nConsider signing up for an automatic savings plan and putting away bonuses and income tax refunds.\\n\\nMake use of tax-advantaged retirement plans, including those sponsored by your employer.\\n\\nNew investment platforms like micro-investing, robo-advisors, and real estate crowdfunding can allow you to invest small amounts regularly.\\n\\nStart With a Budget\\n\\nInvesting is great if you have plenty of extra money lying around. But what if you don't? A lot of people put off saving and investing because they think they don't have enough money, or because retirement is too far away to think about. Others have a lot of debt to shoulder and aren't sure how to tackle both financial tasks responsibly.\\n\\nIf you have a lot of high-interest debt, such as credit card debt, you may want to consider paying it off first. Otherwise, you may lose more to interest payments than you can earn from saving and investing. Look into using the snowball or the avalanche methods to begin paying down debt.\\n\\nOther than money, one of the key things you need to have is discipline. Saving and investing are a commitment, and you'll have an easier time sticking to that commitment if your whole financial picture is organized.\\n\\nStart by making a budget and setting financial goals. Determine your income and monthly spending obligations, such as rent, insurance, or student loan payments. Once you know what you must spend, look at what's left to figure out how much you can reasonably afford to set aside each month.\\n\\nThis will likely be a small amount at first. That's okay. The goal isn't to save thousands of dollars immediately. You want to start building the habit of saving and eventually invest that money to build wealth. Even if you initially have as little as $10 each month, it's better than nothing.\\n\\n\\n\\nOpen a High-Yield Savings Account\\n\\nAn easy way to start building wealth is to open a high-yield savings account. Unlike a standard checking or savings account, high-yield accounts earn significantly higher interest rates. This means that the money you set aside will earn more money for you every month just by being in the bank.\\n\\nTraditional banks may require a minimum deposit for high-yield savings accounts, but many credit unions and online banks have no minimum deposit. You can start with just a few dollars at a time.\\n\\nIf you're trying to save up enough to begin investing in a mutual fund or another investing vehicle with a minimum deposit, a high-yield savings account is a smart place to keep your money until you have saved enough.\\n\\nMake Saving Automatic\\n\\nConsider an automatic savings plan, a savings program offered by many banks and financial institutions, such as Bank of America's Keep the Change Program.\\n\\nThese automatic plans don't require you to do much. You can continue your normal spending and banking. The bank will round purchases made with your debit card to the nearest dollar, then deposit the change daily into your savings account for free. At the end of the year, you receive a statement letting you know how much you've saved.\\n\\nThe account into which your bank deposits round-ups won't earn much interest. But automatic saving is a small, easy step you can take toward beginning to create a savings cushion. Best of all, it will happen whether you are planning for it or not.\\n\\nOnce you've started to build up a good cushion in your account, you can transfer it to a high-yield account or look into investing it elsewhere.\\n\\nSet Aside Bonuses and Refunds\\n\\nIf you get an employee bonus or a tax refund, it can be tempting to use it as extra income. But since it's money you weren't counting on, a better long-term strategy is to treat it as an extra investment. Since these are generally additional to regular earnings, you're less likely to feel the pinch if you put them away.\\n\\nLoyalty programs and credit cards that offer cash-back rewards are other tools that can further your savings goals. Since this is extra money that you're not actually earning from your job—meaning it won't affect your monthly budget if you put it aside—you may want to consider participating in these types of programs as well. Then, when you get cash-back rewards, set them aside in a separate account for investing.\\n\\nIf you are using a cash-back credit card to get the rewards, make sure you are paying off your balance each month. Otherwise, you may spend far more in interest payments than you can earn in rewards.\\n\\nIf your bonus or tax refund is large enough, you can use it to open an account at a brokerage and start investing. Rather than picking individual stocks, which can be challenging for new investors, look into exchange-traded funds or mutual funds.\\n\\nMutual Funds\\n\\nA mutual fund is a single fund that invests in a variety of stocks, bonds, and other assets. They are run by professional money managers. Different funds have different goals; for example, some may focus on stocks from specific types of companies. Others may focus on dividends (regular payments made to investors). Either way, since a professional is running the fund, you don't need to pick the assets. You choose one fund, and someone else takes it from there.\\n\\nFor smaller investments, hundreds of mutual funds allow a small initial investment of $500 or less. Morningstar’s mutual fund screener lists 200 different mutual funds that will accept a $500 minimum deposit.\\n\\nWhen you are just starting to invest, any dividends your mutual fund pays will likely be quite small. Instead of getting a check for a few dollars every month, look for funds that will automatically reinvest your dividends, which grows your investment portfolio.\\n\\nExchange-Traded Funds\\n\\nExchange-traded funds (ETFs) are similar to mutual funds, except that while mutual funds' prices are set at the end of the trading day, ETFs trade like stocks, and their values change based on each trade. For example, you can buy an ETF like the Standard & Poor's depository receipt (SPDR) Trust, which attempts to mimic the performance of the S&P 500 without the hassle and costs associated with purchasing 500 individual stocks.\\n\\nETFs not only provide the opportunity to own a single investment that encompasses a large number of stocks but also offer the opportunity to diversify your portfolio. Like mutual funds, a variety of ETFs are available to match your investing goals. A number of financial websites contain readily available information the average investor can use to research ETFs and their performance simply by searching the ETF ticker symbol.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor smaller investments, hundreds of mutual funds allow a small initial investment of $500 or less.\\n\\n\\n\\nOnce you're ready to invest, check out low-cost online brokers. A good place to start is Investopedia's list of the best discount brokers.\\n\\nUse Alternate Forms of Investing\\n\\nNew technologies and software companies have also created other ways of investing outside of managing your own brokerage account. For many new investors, these platforms are more accessible and can help you start investing sooner.\\n\\nMicro-Investing\\n\\nMicro-investing apps let you invest small sums of money to buy fractional shares of mutual funds or stocks. For many, minimum investments start around $5. This low barrier to entry means you can start investing, even if you don't yet have much saved.\\n\\nFor example, Acorns, a micro-investing app, works like an automatic savings account. You choose what type of investment account you want to open and connect the app to your bank account. When you make a purchase, the amount is rounded up to the nearest dollar, and the extra is automatically invested in your Acorns account.\\n\\n\\n\\nBefore beginning to use an investing app, check the platform's security features to make sure that your money will be protected with FDIC insurance.\\n\\nRobo-Advisors\\n\\nRobo-advisors are automated financial planning platforms driven by algorithms. They were created to make investing as simple and accessible as possible. With little to no human contact, these companies collect your financial information and goals, offer advice, then invest your assets automatically, enabling you to pay lower fees.\\n\\n\\n\\nThese platforms can be especially helpful for those at the beginning of their journey to financial independence. The 2022 Investopedia Financial Literacy Survey found that Generation Z adults (i.e., those 18 to 25 years old) were more financially sophisticated than any prior generation was at their age. However, even though 26% of those surveyed were already invested in the stock market, only one-fourth of this group felt they understood the market well enough to explain it to someone else.\\n\\nGet Your 401(k) Match\\n\\nParticipate in your employer's 401(k) plan, especially if it includes a match. Take time to read the descriptions of each investment the plan offers, figure out how much you can set aside from each paycheck, and determine your level of comfort with the various tiers of risk the plan's investments hold. Index funds are a good start for people who aren't familiar with the particulars of investing, and most, if not all, 401(k) plans offer them.\\n\\nResearching your options is a critical step if you want to maximize your returns. Take time once a year to reassess your plan to ensure that your fund is meeting your investing goals. Don't forget to rebalance your investments. Past performance is a good predictor of the future, but remember, it's not always a guarantee.\\n\\nMany financial websites have excellent resources to research the performance of individual stocks as well specific mutual funds. Keep in mind that a fund's performance is only one of many important parts of the equation. Watch out for excessive administrative fees, which can eat away at your earnings.\\n\\nIn 2006, a flurry of lawsuits over 401(k) plan fees prompted an investigation by a congressional committee into fee disclosure.\\n\\nOpen a Roth IRA\\n\\nApproximately 57 million Americans work for employers that don't offer a 401(k) plan, but that doesn't mean those workers can't successfully save and invest on their own.\\n\\nIf you don't have a workplace retirement plan, you can still open a Roth IRA for yourself. (You can also open a Roth IRA even if you have a 401(k) at work.) This is a tax-advantaged retirement savings account, and most banks and brokerages will allow you to open one. If your bank has a minimum initial investment that is too high for you, many micro-investing apps offer IRAs as well.\\n\\nIn 2023, you can contribute up to $6,500, or $7,500 if you are over age 50. This money won't be taxed when you withdraw it after retirement.\\n\\n\\n\\nReal Estate Crowdfunding\\n\\nIn the past, investing in real estate was a lofty ideal for the average investor, but not anymore. Real estate crowdfunding is a new style of investing that raises capital for real estate projects and investments via the internet and social media outlets.\\n\\nWhen investors engage with a crowdfunding company, that company invests their cash in a series of real estate projects, including hotels, medical facilities, and condominiums. Many of the best real estate crowdfunding sites will accept low initial investments, allowing average investors to reap the rewards of owning real estate while cutting out the headaches and large expenses related to property ownership.\\n\\nHow Do I Start Investing on a Small Budget? To start investing on a small budget, sign up for an automatic savings plan through your bank, then transfer your money to a high-yield savings account where it can start to earn interest. If you receive a bonus at work or a tax refund, set it aside for investing, rather than spending. If your employer offers a 401(k) match, make sure you are contributing enough from your paycheck to get the full match. If you want to invest in traditional mutual funds, look for one that has an initial investment of $500 or less.\\n\\n\\n\\nHow Can I Minimize Investing Fees? You can minimize investing fees by using a micro-investing app or a robo-advisor. Since most of these platforms are automated, they can charge lower fees than traditional brokerage firms. If you do use a traditional brokerage, always check the fees before you make an investment decision.\\n\\nIs $100 Too Little to Invest? There are many ways to start investing with as little as $100 or less. Instead of opening a traditional brokerage account, look into a micro-investing app or a robo-advisor. Many of these investment platforms have low minimum initial investments. It is better to start investing sooner rather than later, even if you can only contribute a small amount. This lets your money grow over time through compound interest.\\n\\nThe Bottom Line\\n\\nWhen it comes to investing, it isn't the amount that matters—it's getting started. Start by getting your finances organized with a budget and by paying down debt. Then begin setting aside small amounts of money every month, even if it's just $5 to start.\\n\\nBy using high-yield savings accounts and new investment platforms, you may be able to start investing sooner than you thought possible. And when you invest now, your money has more time to grow and build wealth.\")),\n",

The unsteady first working years, the high average student loan balances, and the disappearance of defined benefit plans (or pensions) mean millennials have been fighting an uphill battle most of their working lives.\\n\\nStill, many financial advisors are impressed with millennials and how they have prioritized their finances, and for good reason. The digital native generation is also tech-savvy when it comes to figuring out the best ways to save for their futures.\\n\\nBut even the most dedicated saver can use expert advice on juggling competing financial priorities. We asked top financial advisors for their insight for millennials who want to get the most out of their money.\\n\\nKey Takeaways Sixty-four percent of millennials have investments, making them the most invested generation.\\n\\nMany millennials graduated at the height of the Great Recession, which left them with high levels of student loan debt.\\n\\nSocial media platforms like LinkedIn, X (formerly Twitter), YouTube, and TikTok are rising in popularity among millennials as sources of financial information.\\n\\nFinancial advisors emphasize the importance of emergency savings in helping millennials stay on track.\\n\\nThe 50/30/20 budget rule is a simple way for millennials to allocate their after-tax dollars to account for needs, wants, and savings.\\n\\nFirst: What Millennials Are Getting Right\\n\\nAvocado toast and craft coffees aren’t making planning for their financial future hard for millennials. Millennials earn 20% less than baby boomers earned at the same age. Arguably, millennials have gotten the fuzzy end of the lollipop regarding their financial health.\\n\\nStill, according to financial advisors like Douglas Boneparth, president of Bone Fide Wealth, millennials use the past to fuel their financial futures. Boneparth “thinks the trauma of the Great Recession has made millennials very aware of savings and emergency funds,” which creates a stronger foundation that allows them to be in the accumulation phase during their higher earning years.\\n\\nMelissa Joy, certified financial planner (CFP) and certified divorce financial analyst (CDFA), agrees. She says, “Millennials are responsible for their money and making great choices.” Joy is particularly encouraged by how comfortably millennials navigate retirement through company programs.\\n\\nJoy also finds in her practice that once millennials feel they have a handle on balancing their debt, earnings, and current savings, they seek information about the next steps.\\n\\nEven for millennials with no prior savings or plans for the future, all is not lost. Joy says, “If you feel like you are behind, now is such a good time to get to investing. Now, you are entering your high-earning years. There is no better time than the present to use your human capital to improve your picture.”\\n\\nEmergency Savings Are Very Important\\n\\nAll the financial advisors interviewed in this article agreed that having emergency savings is the foundation of a sound financial plan. Life happens, and Joy emphasizes that the security of an emergency savings account can help millennials stick to their goals.\\n\\nSure, millennials could skip the emergency fund and instead invest that money. However, the average credit card interest rate for users with a balance is 22.75% as of November 2023. Even the best investment will have a hard time outpacing 22.75% interest.\\n\\nTip Individuals without emergency savings are more likely to use credit cards or debt to cover emergency costs.\\n\\nBoneparth sums up the importance of emergency savings by saying, “Give yourself the opportunity to feel safe and secure before you even start investing. Starting early is important, but what good is compounding if you can’t stay invested? This way, you can navigate the ups and downs of life without having to worry. The ability to navigate that and stay on your path separates good and bad investors.”\\n\\nSet Clear Priorities\\n\\nMillennials who are most successful in planning their financial futures have clear priorities, say financial advisors.\\n\\n“You cannot have everything you want, so what is the most important thing to you? You need to list it out and really prioritize it,” says Thomas Kopelman, co-founder and financial planner at AllStreet Wealth. “Also, do the opposite. Make a list of things that you can cut.”\\n\\nMany people think investing and planning for the future is just about dollars and cents, but financial advisors know that many money moves are psychological. By clearly establishing priorities and knowing “what it is that you are truly after,” Boneparth says, your goals will motivate you to keep going.\\n\\nMillennials struggling to figure out what is most important can talk to a financial advisor about prioritizing their goals.\\n\\nGive Every Dollar a Job\\n\\nMillennials earn $8 for every $10 that the boomers earned. With that in mind, Nathaniel Hoskin, CFP, accredited wealth management advisor (AWMA), and founder and lead advisor at Hoskin Capital, recommends “giving every dollar a job.” The best way to do that is to create a realistic budget.\\n\\nBudgeting is a critical part of a financial plan, and while there are as many different ways to budget as there are stars in the sky, the most important part of budgeting is seeing where your money is going. Financial advisors know this is an uncomfortable truth for many millennials and that the further we get away from tangible money, the easier it is to ignore. In fact, 65% of people do not know how much money they spent last month.\\n\\nBoneparth echoes that he has seen this in his practice and encourages millennials to be honest about their budgets by budgeting “not based on what you think you are spending but what you know you are spending.”\\n\\nTo face budgeting woes head-on, some financial advisors, like Hoskin, recommend that millennials look at their spending for the three months before they lay out a budget for future expenditures. Hoskin recommends smartphone apps as a quick way to see income vs. expenses for the three prior months without having to backtrack every expense with pencil and paper.\\n\\nFocus on Reverse Budgeting\\n\\nBudgeting will reveal either a surplus or a deficit for millennials. Once millennials know where their money is going, “even if their money is not spreading as far as they want it to,” they can focus on reverse budgeting, says Hoskin. Reverse budgeting means putting money aside for your future self first.\\n\\nKopelman agrees wholeheartedly with Hoskin on reverse budgeting. Hoskin further recommends that millennials take advantage of automated investing and savings. He sees automation as tricking your brain and nervous system into sticking to the strategies. Setting money aside for your future self first by automatic withdrawals or transfers means you are working toward your goals before any of your income is spent.\\n\\nBudgeting is not a set-it-and-forget-it endeavor. Millennials should continue to track their budget and adjust goals as their priorities and income change. An easy place to continually track your budget is with a calculator.\\n\\n“The best we can do is our best,” says Colin Overweg, CFP, founder of Advize Wealth Management. “We cannot predict the future, so we will put together a plan, stick to it, and adjust accordingly.”\\n\\nBe a Goal-Getter with ‘Free Money’\\n\\nAnother way millennials can slay their financial futures is to make sure that they take advantage of all the “free money” offered by their employers.\\n\\nWe know that an overwhelming percentage of millennials are participating in employer-sponsored retirement plans, and they should pat themselves on the back for that. Participating is the first step; taking advantage of employer matching is the next logical step. Hoskin says this should be the watermark for millennials with few extra means. Leaving matching contributions on the table is like walking away from free money.\\n\\nCreate a Financial Plan\\n\\nOnce millennials have established emergency savings and taken advantage of all matching employer contributions, financial advisors recommend working toward tackling those financial goals and priorities based on their budgets.\\n\\nThere are some universally accepted future-focused budgeting tactics, like the 50/30/20 budget rule, where 50% of income is spent on needs, 30% on wants, and 20% on savings. While the 50/30/20 rule is simple, financial advisors tend to agree that saving 20% of income is a solid target, but 15% is a great starting point.\\n\\nThose incapable of saving 20% of their income today should ideally save no less than 10% and incrementally increase it. Joy calls this “matching your lifestyle creep with your savings creep.” Managing the lifestyle creep is where a financial advisor can come in handy as well, because they can help millennials continually reassess the percentage of gross income they’re investing.\\n\\nFinancial advisors want their clients to invest based on their priorities, but they also emphasize the importance of Roth individual retirement accounts (Roth IRAs) for those who qualify. Roth IRAs are accounts in which millennials can invest after-tax dollars. That is beneficial because millennials who wait to withdraw this money until after they are 59½ years old can withdraw this money and its growth tax-free.\\n\\nIf you’re a millennial with your eyes on retirement, there are more resources here to help support your financial future.\\n\\nAdditional Considerations\\n\\nThe most popular source for millennials to get financial advice is social media. Many advisors today exist in the social media space and practice radical generosity with their knowledge and expertise.\\n\\nHowever, as with anything, only some on the internet are experts. Millennials should approach some free financial literacy with the same caution that they might approach an unusual, spam-like social media direct message.\\n\\nMillennials investing in company-sponsored plans need to talk with their plan provider to ensure that their money works for them by being invested appropriately for their target retirement date and risk tolerance. Plan providers can discuss this with millennials, but millennials can also address this with financial advisors as part of their overall picture.\\n\\nJoy also encourages millennials to talk with someone if they have stock options as part of their overall compensation. She has seen ill-prepared millennials make very reactive decisions regarding their stock options. She says planning can make these stock options more integrated into millennials’ financial plans.\\n\\nWhere Do Millennials Get Financial Advice? According to a survey from the National Association of Personal Financial Advisors, most millennials get financial advice from a family member (31%), a website (27%), a trusted friend (26%), a parent (26%), a financial advisor (21%), or social media (20%). Thirty-four percent of millennials and Gen Z respondents said that lack of financial guidance was hurting their ability to manage their retirement plans.\\n\\nHow Are Millennials Investing Their Money? Millennials who are eligible are doing an excellent job of participating in their employer-sponsored plans. Millennials also leverage technology to help them invest in vehicles of their choice.\\n\\nHow Much Should Millennials Save for Retirement? A quick calculation to determine how much money millennials need to save for retirement is known as the 4% rule. Millennials should estimate how much money they would like in retirement per year and divide that amount by 0.04. This number assumes a 30-year life span and a 5% rate of return.\\n\\nThe Bottom Line\\n\\nMillennials are DIY-ing their financial future more than any generation before them, but financial advisors agree they’re doing an OK job. Still, millennials who desire the best outcomes should prioritize goals and budgeting, take advantage of “free money” from their employer, make a savings plan, and stick to it.\\n\\nFinancial advisor Melissa Joy reminds us that perception is not always reality because “you always think everyone is doing better than you are, and that is not always the case.” However, millennials worried about how they stack up should not quit before they begin. It’s not too late to plan for your financial future.\\n\\nDouglas Boneparth reiterates, “The first best time is yesterday. The second best time is today.”')),\n",

Meanwhile, a security describes a tradable financial instrument with monetary value.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhile they are both assets that traders can buy and sell, securities receive stricter regulatory oversight than commodities. Companies that issue securities like stocks and bonds must provide investors with detailed, transparent information, while commodities are subject to less stringent reporting requirements.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe distinction between trading basic goods and trading financial instruments seems clear enough. However, when it comes to digital assets like cryptocurrency, the classification becomes murkier. Depending on your perspective, cryptocurrencies could be considered commodities or securities. How this debate is resolved could have a big impact on the future of crypto.\\n\\n\\n\\nKey Takeaways A commodity is a basic good that can be exchanged with other goods of the same type, while a security is a financial instrument representing an investment in a common enterprise.\\n\\nCommodities are subject to less stringent regulations, while securities involve strict reporting requirements designed to ensure transparency for all investors.\\n\\nThe classification of cryptocurrencies remains a subject of debate, and the determination of whether digital assets are commodities or securities could have widespread implications.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat Is a Commodity?\\n\\nA commodity is a tangible product, often a raw material that can be used to make other products. Hard commodities include energy goods like oil and gas as well as metals like gold and silver, while soft commodities are generally agricultural goods like grains, livestock, and cotton. Traders can buy and sell commodities on the spot market or by using derivatives such as futures and options.\\n\\nA lot of commodities trading takes place between companies that use the goods, like food producers that depend on agricultural products, and industrial companies that use metals. However, it is generally recommended that all investors have some exposure to commodities as part of a diversified portfolio. That's because commodities tend to have a low or negative correlation with other assets like stocks and bonds, often performing well when other areas of the financial market are struggling. Commodities may also be a useful tool for investors aiming to hedge against inflation.\\n\\nThe Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) regulates the trading of derivatives in the U.S. When the commission was established in 1974, agricultural products dominated futures trading. Since then, the markets overseen by the CFTC have become more complex, with fintech and digital currencies underpinning more intricate commodities transactions.\\n\\nWhat Is a Security?\\n\\nA security is a fungible and tradable financial instrument issued by corporations and governments to raise capital. In general, securities represent equity (the rights to an ownership share in an enterprise), debt (loans that are repaid in periodic installments), or a hybrid of equity and debt.\\n\\n\\n\\nSecurities typically refer to stocks and bonds along with related products like mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). However, the legal interpretation of what constitutes a financial security is quite broad. In the case of Howey vs. SEC in 1946, the Supreme Court determined that a contract involving the sale of agricultural land and services represented a security.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis case resulted in a list of criteria—known as the Howey Test—to determine whether instruments should be regulated as a security. According to federal laws, a financial contract meets the threshold of a security if there is an investment of money made in a common enterprise in anticipation of a profit driven by the efforts of others.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen a corporation or government entity wants to raise capital from the public by issuing securities, it must follow strict reporting requirements set out by the SEC. These rules are designed to ensure transparency in the securities market, ensuring that investors have access to all the information they need to make informed decisions.\\n\\n\\n\\nKey Differences\\n\\nThe fundamental difference between a commodity and a security hinges on what is being bought and sold. Commodities are basic goods that can be traded or exchanged, while securities involve taking an ownership stake or providing credit to a common enterprise with the hopes of earning a profit.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis distinction is evident in the different regulatory organizations and regimes put in place to supervise the commodities and securities markets. In general, commodities are subject to less stringent oversight by the CFTC, while securities are required to meet the stricter regulatory and enforcement policies of the SEC.\\n\\n\\n\\nIs Cryptocurrency a Commodity or Security?\\n\\nThe differentiation between commodities and securities may seem relatively straightforward when it comes to traditional assets like gold and oil or stocks and bonds. However, digital assets like cryptocurrencies have stretched the delineation between the two types of assets.\\n\\nThe debate over whether cryptocurrencies constitute commodities or securities remains unresolved. In fact, the intricacies of the question may make it impractical to come up with a one-size-fits-all solution, with some cryptocurrency tokens presenting characteristics more like commodities, while there are valid arguments for considering some cryptocurrencies as securities.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe ultimate determination of how to classify crypto will likely have a significant impact on how digital assets are regulated and determine the future of the cryptocurrency industry.\\n\\n\\n\\nCryptocurrencies as Commodities\\n\\nSince securities are subject to tighter regulations, it may come as no surprise that crypto industry executives and proponents argue that cryptocurrencies should be considered commodities. According to their perspective, cryptocurrencies are used as a store of value, similar to commodities like gold. Traders and investors may purchase crypto assets for speculative purposes—hoping to profit from price swings—which is another way that cryptocurrencies mirror commodities.\\n\\nAnother key argument that cryptocurrencies should not be considered securities revolves around their decentralized nature. The Howey test specifies that a security involves investing in a common enterprise and profiting from the efforts of a third party. The lack of a centralized entity underlying cryptocurrencies supports the idea that they should be classified as commodities rather than securities.\\n\\nCryptocurrencies as Securities\\n\\nAlthough crypto advocates generally argue against the more stringent regulations that would come from classifying the digital assets as securities, subjecting crypto to securities rules could make the assets more attractive to a wider range of investors.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn addition, there are some elements of the cryptocurrency markets that seem to fall closer in line with the definition of a security. For instance, when blockchain or crypto-related companies raise capital through initial coin offerings (ICOs), they issue digital coins that allow investors to participate in the crypto project and earn a share of its profits. Therefore, ICOs resemble the initial public offerings (IPOs) that companies use to bring their stock onto the public markets, lending credence to the idea that they should be similarly regulated as securities.\\n\\n\\n\\nOther areas of the crypto markets are reminiscent of debt securities. For example, crypto lenders may provide credit in the form of cryptocurrency in exchange for interest or fees—a structure that closely resembles bonds.\\n\\nIs Bitcoin a Security or a Commodity? There is an ongoing debate about whether Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies should be classified as a security or a commodity. The decentralized nature of Bitcoin raises questions about whether the asset meets the criteria of the Howey Test that would classify it as a security. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) considers Bitcoin to be a commodity and asserts that it holds regulatory authority over BTC under the Commodity Exchange Act.\\n\\n\\n\\nIs Ethereum a Commodity or Security? Much like Bitcoin, Ethereum remains in a regulatory grey area and subject to differences in opinion about its classification. When it filed its lawsuit against Binance, the CFTC explicitly declared that Ethereum, along with Bitcoin and Litecoin, are considered commodities. However, the SEC has applied the Howey Test and argued that other crypto tokens such as Ripple's XRP are securities and should be subject to the associated regulations.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhy Is a Commodity Not a Security? Commodities—such as energy assets like oil, metals like gold, and agriculture products like corn—are not considered securities because they do not involve investing in a common enterprise and profiting from the efforts of others.\\n\\n\\n\\nCan a Commodity Become a Security? Commodities can serve as the underlying asset for derivatives such as futures and options. Futures establish an obligation to buy or sell a commodity at a set price and date in the future, while options provide holders with the right (but not the obligation) to buy or sell the commodity.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Bottom Line\\n\\nAssets are traditionally classified as either commodities, which are basic goods used in making other products, or securities, which are financial instruments designed to generate profits from a shared enterprise.

But the stock market\\'s long-term record is dotted with downturns that shake the confidence of some investors. For example, the 49.1% drop in the S&P 500 in 2000 took 56 months (or 4.6 years) to recover from.\\n\\nThe search for someplace for your money beyond banks and other financial institutions can occur due to a lack of confidence in a government or financial system, losses suffered due to a financial crisis, or simply a belief in the value of having other ways to protect and grow your funds.\\n\\nHere are seven suggestions. One, in particular, is considered the safest place for your cash.\\n\\nKey Takeaways FDIC protection for bank deposits is reassuring but it may be smart to have other choices for your money, as well.\\n\\nFederal bonds are considered very safe, but as a result, returns can be low.\\n\\nReal estate investments can produce income but may be risky.\\n\\nPrecious metals, especially gold, offer an alternative to stocks and bonds.\\n\\nCash \"under the mattress\" can make sense to some but it isn’t secure, earns no return, and loses value due to inflation.\\n\\n7 Places to Keep Your Money\\n\\n1. Federal Bonds\\n\\nThe U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve (Fed) would be more than happy to take your funds and issue you securities in return. A U.S. government bond still qualifies in most textbooks as a risk-free security.\\n\\nUnfortunately, because they\\'re considered free of risk, government bonds have lower returns than other types of debt. For example, in March, 2020, the yield from a 10-Year Treasury Note was just 0.318%, an all-time low.\\n\\nAfter the Fed started raising the federal funds rate in 2022 to combat high inflation, rates rose to more attractive levels. That 10-Year Treasury rate was 4.27% as of Feb. 28, 2024. But once inflation is back under control, rates are expected to drop.\\n\\nIf the low rates don\\'t deter you, U.S. government bonds provide one of the safest places to put cash.\\n\\n2. Real Estate\\n\\nIn disquieting times for the banks, the allure of real estate investments can be strong. Become a landlord. Put down some of your principal on a property, fix it up a bit, rent it out, and have your tenants pay off the mortgage. If you\\'re interested in a shorter-term opportunity and have more experience, maybe try flipping houses.\\n\\nOr consider putting money in real estate investment trusts (REITs), an easier, more convenient, and less expensive way to invest in real estate for many people.\\n\\nDone right, real estate can have a huge financial upside. Residential and diversified real estate investments averaged about a 10% return through early 2021, which was slightly better than the S&P 500 in that period.\\n\\nYet it can also be a risky and sometimes fickle investment. As of Feb. 28, 2024, the Dow Jones Equity All REIT index showed a one-year return of -0.91% and a 10-year return of 2.87%.\\n\\nIn the short term, real estate can be an unreliable investment. An extreme example is the housing bubble that burst and led to the Great Recession. The global economic downturn that began in 2007 resulted in a housing market crash and millions of people losing their jobs and homes.\\n\\nInvestments in stocks and bonds are not insured by the FDIC. However, the Securities Investor Protection Corporation, known as SIPC, does protect cash and securities held in customer accounts at thousands of brokerages, up to a value of $500,000 per account.\\n\\n3. Precious Metals\\n\\nOne doomsday scenario in which financial markets cease to function holds that gold, silver, and other metals such as platinum or copper will continue to retain their value, if not appreciate.\\n\\nThe likelihood of having to return to a barter system with physical goods is minimal, but it may make sense to hold some percentage of your assets in precious metals. Precious metals historically have had a low or negative correlation to other asset classes like stocks and bonds. That means when those investments go south, metals are unlikely to follow, at least very far, and may even increase in value.\\n\\n4. Luxury Assets\\n\\nThis category of tangible assets encompasses fine art, cars, watches, diamonds, and other jewels, and just about anything that qualifies as a collectible.\\n\\nIn their favor, they\\'re objects that can be seen, held, and sold, compared to a bank account that could take time to collect on if the financial institution that housed it ceases to exist.\\n\\nThat said, luxury investments are hardly a sure bet. Data on their historical returns are elusive. They are generally thought to lag stock market returns. Yet they have periods of rapid appreciation due to either strong financial market performance or periods of popularity (when underlying demand increases, pushing value up).\\n\\n5. Cash, Hidden Away\\n\\nStuffing money under your mattress is a cliché. Yet keeping funds at home unquestionably keeps them close at hand, if not necessarily as secure as they might be in a bank. You could also hide your assets in a safe deposit box or safe.\\n\\nIt\\'s probably a good idea to keep some amount of cash within easy reach for those times when you can\\'t get to your financial institution but find yourself in a short-term liquidity crunch.\\n\\nYou may experience more extreme circumstances such as a natural disaster (e.g., earthquake, tornado, flood) that prevents access to your bank. The threat of a cyber-attack has become increasingly real; your financial institution, the financial markets, or the entire financial system may be offline for days.\\n\\nEven so, carefully consider how much cash you keep at home because inflation will steadily erode the value of currency over time.\\n\\nFast Fact Cash held in a safe deposit box at a financial institution is not insured.\\n\\n6. Businesses\\n\\nBuying a business can provide a return on your investment, as long as the enterprise generates a profit. In very bad times, businesses can suffer and even close.\\n\\nBut if the idea of investing in a particular business interests you, consider a farm. It\\'s a particularly tangible business (if not always a profitable one). You don\\'t necessarily need to get your hands dirty. With a so-called investment farm, you hire staff to handle the actual agricultural operations.\\n\\nOwning farmland is a good fit for those with a survivalist mindset, too, since the land can produce food on the off-chance of a societal calamity or a meltdown of the global financial system.\\n\\n7. Cryptocurrency\\n\\nCryptocurrencies are another alternative investment option. While Bitcoin may be the most well-known, there are a number of other crypto choices.\\n\\nCrypto offers individual investors a unique opportunity to get into what is still an emerging technology.\\n\\nBut bear in mind that it is also a high-risk, high-reward opportunity. For example, after soaring to stratospheric highs, bitcoin lost about three-quarters of its value in 2018.\\n\\nYou shouldn\\'t invest much, or any, funds in cryptocurrencies that you need to rely on for your future. Yet for other discretionary capital that you may have, they offer the potential for attractive returns. Most analysts concur that crypto is here to stay.\\n\\nWhere Do Banks Invest Their Money? Banks offer their customers a place to stash their cash safely, usually for a very modest rate of interest. In turn, the banks invest that cash, aiming to earn more money than they pay out to customers. They lend it to businesses and consumers as loans, making a profit from the interest payments. They also make money on the fees they charge their customers for various services. In addition, banks invest a portion of their deposits directly in assets such as real estate, bonds, and stocks.\\n\\nWhere Can I Buy Gold and Silver? You may be able to buy gold and silver bars and coins at a local bank or local precious metals dealer. However, online dealers may offer the greatest choice of purchasing options.\\n\\nCan I Invest in Bitcoin ETFs? Yes, spot bitcoin ETFs began trading in the U.S. in 2024. They\\'re available at online and full-service brokerages and can be bought for taxable or non-taxable (retirement) accounts.\\n\\nThe Bottom Line\\n\\nBanks and the stock market may always be looked upon with some suspicion by savers and investors who have experienced financial losses related to one or the other.\\n\\nFor the especially wary, the seven alternatives to a traditional bank or stocks noted above may make sense for at least a percentage of their net worth. But given their risk, none should comprise too large a component of your total investments.')),\n",

The company pools clients’ risks to make payments more affordable for the insured. Most people have some insurance: for their car, their house, their healthcare, or their life.\\n\\nInsurance policies hedge against financial losses resulting from accidents, injury, or property damage. Insurance also helps cover costs associated with liability (legal responsibility) for damage or injury caused to a third party.\\n\\nKey Takeaways Insurance is a contract (policy) in which an insurer indemnifies another against losses from specific contingencies or perils.\\n\\nThere are many types of insurance policies. Life, health, homeowners, and auto are among the most common forms of insurance.\\n\\nThe core components that make up most insurance policies are the premium, deductible, and policy limits.\\n\\nInvestopedia / Daniel Fishel\\n\\nHow Insurance Works\\n\\nMany insurance policy types are available, and virtually any individual or business can find an insurance company willing to insure them—for a price. Common personal insurance policy types are auto, health, homeowners, and life insurance. Most individuals in the United States have at least one of these types of insurance, and car insurance is required by state law.\\n\\nBusinesses obtain insurance policies for field-specific risks, For example, a fast-food restaurant's policy may cover an employee's injuries from cooking with a deep fryer. Medical malpractice insurance covers injury- or death-related liability claims resulting from the health care provider's negligence or malpractice. A company may use an insurance broker of record to help them manage the policies of its employees. Businesses may be required by state law to buy specific insurance coverages.\\n\\nMost insurance is regulated at the state level.\\n\\nThere are also insurance policies available for very specific needs. Such coverage includes business closures due to civil authority, kidnap, ransom, and extortion (K&R) insurance, identity theft insurance, and wedding liability and cancellation insurance.\\n\\nInsurance Policy Components\\n\\nUnderstanding how insurance works can help you choose a policy. For instance, comprehensive coverage may or may not be the right type of auto insurance for you. Three components of any insurance type are the premium, policy limit, and deductible.\\n\\nPremium\\n\\nA policy’s premium is its price, typically a monthly cost. Often, an insurer takes multiple factors into account to set a premium. Here are a few examples:\\n\\nAuto insurance premiums : Your history of property and auto claims, age and location, creditworthiness, and many other factors that may vary by state.\\n\\n: Your history of property and auto claims, age and location, creditworthiness, and many other factors that may vary by state. Home insurance premiums : The value of your home, personal belongings, location, claims history, and coverage amounts.\\n\\n: The value of your home, personal belongings, location, claims history, and coverage amounts. Health insurance premiums : Age, sex, location, health status, and coverage levels.\\n\\n: Age, sex, location, health status, and coverage levels. Life insurance premiums: Age, sex, tobacco use, health, and amount of coverage.\\n\\nMuch depends on the insurer's perception of your risk for a claim. For example, suppose you own several expensive automobiles and have a history of reckless driving. In that case, you will likely pay more for an auto policy than someone with a single midrange sedan and a perfect driving record. However, different insurers may charge different premiums for similar policies. So finding the price that is right for you requires some legwork.\\n\\nPolicy Limit\\n\\nThe policy limit is the maximum amount an insurer will pay for a covered loss under a policy. Maximums may be set per period (e.g., annual or policy term), per loss or injury, or over the life of the policy, also known as the lifetime maximum.\\n\\nTypically, higher limits carry higher premiums. For a general life insurance policy, the maximum amount that the insurer will pay is referred to as the face value. This is the amount paid to your beneficiary upon your death.\\n\\nThe federal Affordable Care Act (ACA) prevents ACA-compliant plans from instituting a lifetime limit for essential healthcare benefits such as family planning, maternity services, and pediatric care.\\n\\nDeductible\\n\\nThe deductible is a specific amount you pay out of pocket before the insurer pays a claim. Deductibles serve as deterrents to large volumes of small and insignificant claims.\\n\\nFor example, a $1,000 deductible means you pay the first $1,000 toward any claims. Suppose your car's damage totals $2,000. You pay the first $1,000, and your insurer pays the remaining $1,000.\\n\\nDeductibles can apply per policy or claim, depending on the insurer and the type of policy. Health plans may have an individual deductible and a family deductible. Policies with high deductibles are typically less expensive because the high out-of-pocket expense generally results in fewer small claims.\\n\\nTypes of Insurance\\n\\nThe National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) compiles an index of complaints about insurance companies. This information comes from state insurance regulators. The NAIC then compares the number of complaints to the insurance company's market share.\\n\\nThere are many different types of insurance. Let’s look at the most important.\\n\\n\\n\\nHealth Insurance\\n\\nHealth insurance helps covers routine and emergency medical care costs, often with the option to add vision and dental services separately. In addition to an annual deductible, you may also pay copays and coinsurance, which are your fixed payments or percentage of a covered medical benefit after meeting the deductible. However, many preventive services may be covered for free before these are met.\\n\\nHealth insurance may be purchased from an insurance company, an insurance agent, the federal Health Insurance Marketplace, provided by an employer, or federal Medicare and Medicaid coverage.\\n\\nThe federal government no longer requires Americans to have health insurance, but in some states, such as California, you may pay a tax penalty if you don't have insurance.\\n\\nIf you have chronic health issues or need regular medical attention, look for a health insurance policy with a lower deductible. Though the annual premium is higher than a comparable policy with a higher deductible, less-expensive medical care year-round may be worth the tradeoff.\\n\\nHome Insurance\\n\\nHomeowners insurance (also known as home insurance) protects your home, other property structures, and personal possessions against natural disasters, unexpected damage, theft, and vandalism. Homeowner insurance won't cover floods or earthquakes, which you'll have to protect against separately. Policy providers usually offer riders to increase coverage for specific properties or events and provisions that can help reduce deductible amounts. These adders will come at an additional premium amount.\\n\\nRenter's insurance is another type of homeowners insurance.\\n\\nYour lender or landlord will likely require you to have homeowners insurance coverage. Where homes are concerned, you don't have coverage or stop paying your insurance bill your mortgage lender is allowed to buy homeowners insurance for you and charge you for it.\\n\\nAuto Insurance\\n\\nAuto insurance can help pay claims if you injure or damage someone else's property in a car accident, help pay for accident-related repairs on your vehicle, or repair or replace your vehicle if stolen, vandalized, or damaged by a natural disaster.\\n\\nInstead of paying out of pocket for auto accidents and damage, people pay annual premiums to an auto insurance company. The company then pays all or most of the covered costs associated with an auto accident or other vehicle damage.\\n\\nIf you have a leased vehicle or borrowed money to buy a car, your lender or leasing dealership will likely require you to carry auto insurance. As with homeowners insurance, the lender may purchase insurance for you if necessary.\\n\\nLife Insurance\\n\\nA life insurance policy guarantees that the insurer pays a sum of money to your beneficiaries (such as a spouse or children) if you die. In exchange, you pay premiums during your lifetime.\\n\\nThere are two main types of life insurance. Term life insurance covers you for a specific period, such as 10 to 20 years. If you die during that period, your beneficiaries receive a payment. Permanent life insurance covers your whole life as long as you continue paying the premiums.\\n\\n\\n\\nTravel Insurance\\n\\nTravel insurance covers the costs and losses associated with traveling, including trip cancellations or delays, coverage for emergency health care, injuries and evacuations, damaged baggage, rental cars, and rental homes. However, even some of the best travel insurance companies do not cover cancellations or delays due to weather, terrorism, or a pandemic. They also don't often cover injuries from extreme sports or high-adventure activities.\\n\\nWhat Is Insurance? Insurance is a way to manage your financial risks. When you buy insurance, you purchase protection against unexpected financial losses. The insurance company pays you or someone you choose if something bad occurs. If you have no insurance and an accident happens, you may be responsible for all related costs.\\n\\nWhy Is Insurance Important? Insurance helps protect you, your family, and your assets. An insurer will help you cover the costs of unexpected and routine medical bills or hospitalization, accident damage to your car or injury of others, and home damage or theft of your belongings. An insurance policy can even provide your survivors with a lump-sum cash payment if you die. In short, insurance can offer peace of mind regarding unforeseen financial risks.\\n\\nIs Insurance an Asset? Depending on the type of life insurance policy and how it is used, permanent or variable life insurance could be considered a financial asset because it can build cash value or be converted into cash. Simply put, most permanent life insurance policies have the ability to build cash value over time.\\n\\nThe Bottom Line\\n\\nInsurance helps to protect you and your family against unexpected financial costs and resulting debts or the risk of losing your assets. Insurance helps protect you from expensive lawsuits, injuries and damages, death, and even total losses of your car or home.\\n\\nSometimes, your state or lender may require you to carry insurance. Although there are many insurance policy types, some of the most common are life, health, homeowners, and auto. The right type of insurance for you will depend on your goals and financial situation.\")),\n",

It also means budgeting to grow a nest egg that will allow you to retire or pursue any career you want—without being driven by the need to earn a certain amount each year.\\n\\nUnfortunately, too many people fall far short of financial freedom. Even without occasional financial emergencies, escalating debt due to overspending is a constant burden that keeps them from reaching their goals. When a major crisis—such as a hurricane, an earthquake, or a pandemic—completely disrupts all plans, additional holes in safety nets are revealed.\\n\\nTrouble happens to nearly everyone, but these 12 habits can put you on the right path.\\n\\nKey Takeaways Set life goals—big and small, financial and lifestyle—and create a blueprint for achieving those goals.\\n\\nMake a budget to cover all your financial needs and stick to it.\\n\\nPay off credit cards in full, carry as little debt as possible, and keep an eye on your credit score.\\n\\nCreate automatic savings by setting up an emergency fund and contributing to your employer’s retirement plan.\\n\\nTake care of your belongings—maintenance is cheaper than replacement—but most importantly, take care of your health.\\n\\nBeing Financially Independent Being financially independent means having sufficient income, savings, or investments to live comfortably for life and meet all of one's obligations without relying on a paycheck. That is the ultimate goal of a long-term financial plan.\\n\\n1. Set Life Goals\\n\\nWhat is financial freedom to you? Everyone has a general desire for it, but that's too vague a goal. You need to get specific about amounts and deadlines. The more specific your goals, the higher the likelihood of achieving them.\\n\\nWrite down these three objectives:\\n\\nWhat your lifestyle requires How much you should have in your bank account to make that possible What age is the deadline to save that amount\\n\\nNext, count backward from your deadline age to your current age and establish financial mileposts at regular intervals between the two dates. Write all amounts and deadlines down carefully and put the goal sheet at the front of your financial binder.\\n\\n2. Make a Monthly Budget\\n\\nMaking a monthly household budget—and sticking to it—is the best way to guarantee that all bills are paid and savings are on track. It’s also a regular routine that reinforces your goals and bolsters resolve against the temptation to splurge.\\n\\n3. Pay off Credit Cards in Full\\n\\nCredit cards and other high-interest consumer loans are toxic to wealth-building. Make it a point to pay off the full balance each month. Student loans, mortgages, and similar loans typically have much lower interest rates; paying them off is not an emergency. However, paying these lower-interest loans on time is still important—and on-time payments will build a good credit rating.\\n\\n4. Create Automatic Savings\\n\\nPay yourself first. Enroll in your employer’s retirement plan and make full use of any matching contribution benefit, which is essentially free money. It’s also wise to have an automatic withdrawal into an emergency fund, which can be tapped for unexpected expenses, as well as an automatic contribution to a brokerage account or something similar.\\n\\nIdeally, the money for the emergency fund and the retirement fund should be pulled out of your account the same day you receive your paycheck, so it never even touches your hands.\\n\\nKeep in mind that the recommended amount to save in an emergency fund depends on your individual circumstances. Also, tax-advantaged retirement accounts come with rules that make it difficult to get your hands on your cash should you suddenly need it, so that account should not be your only emergency fund.\\n\\n5. Start Investing Now\\n\\nBad stock markets—known as bear markets—can make people question the wisdom of investing, but historically there has been no better way to grow your money. The magic of compound interest alone will grow your money exponentially, but you do need a lot of time to achieve meaningful growth.\\n\\nHowever, remember that—for everyone except professional investors—it would be a mistake to attempt the kind of stock picking made famous by billionaires like Warren Buffett. Instead, open an online brokerage account that makes it easy for you to learn how to invest, create a manageable portfolio, and make weekly or monthly contributions to it automatically. We’ve ranked the best online brokers for beginners to help you get started.\\n\\nAchieving financial freedom can be very difficult in the face of growing debt, cash emergencies, medical issues, and overspending, but—with discipline and careful planning—it is possible. That is the ultimate goal of\\n\\n6. Watch Your Credit Score\\n\\nYour credit score is a very important number that determines the interest rate you are offered when buying a new car or refinancing a home. It also impacts the amount you pay for a range of other essentials, from car insurance to life insurance premiums.\\n\\nThe reason credit scores have so much weight is that someone with reckless financial habits is considered likely to be reckless in other areas of life, such as not looking after their health—or even driving and drinking.\\n\\nThis is why it’s important to get a credit report at regular intervals to make sure that there are no erroneous black marks ruining your good name. It may also be worth looking into a reputable credit monitoring service to protect your information.\\n\\n7. Negotiate for Goods and Services\\n\\nMany Americans are hesitant to negotiate for goods and services, because they're afraid that it makes them seem cheap. Conquer this fear and you could save thousands each year. Small businesses, in particular, tend to be open to negotiation, so buying in bulk or positioning yourself as a repeat customer can open the door to good discounts.\\n\\n8. Stay Educated on Financial Issues\\n\\nReview relevant changes in tax law to ensure that all adjustments and deductions are maximized each year. Keep up with financial news and developments in the stock market and do not hesitate to adjust your investment portfolio accordingly. Knowledge is also the best defense against fraudsters who prey on unsophisticated investors to turn a quick buck.\\n\\n9. Maintain Your Property\\n\\nTaking good care of property makes everything from cars and lawnmowers to shoes and clothes last longer. The cost of maintenance is a fraction of the cost of replacement, so it’s an investment not to be missed.\\n\\nLearn to know the difference between the things you want and the things you need.\\n\\n10. Live Below Your Means\\n\\nMastering a frugal lifestyle means developing a mindset focused on living a good life with less—and it's easier than you think. In fact, before rising to affluence, many wealthy individuals developed the habit of living below their means.\\n\\nThis isn’t a challenge to adopt a minimalist lifestyle. It simply means learning to distinguish between the things you need and the things you want—and then making small adjustments that drive big gains for your financial health.\\n\\n11. Get a Financial Advisor\\n\\nOnce you’ve gotten to a point where you’ve amassed a decent amount of wealth—either liquid assets (cash or anything easily converted to cash) or fixed assets (property or anything not easily converted to cash)—get a financial advisor to help you stay on the right path.\\n\\n12. Take Care of Your Health\\n\\nThe principle of proper maintenance also applies to your body—and taking excellent care of your physical health has a significant positive impact on your financial health as well.\\n\\nInvesting in good health is not difficult. It means making regular visits to doctors and dentists, and following health advice about any problems you encounter. Many medical issues can be helped—or even prevented—with basic lifestyle changes, such as more exercise and a healthier diet.\\n\\nPoor health maintenance, on the other hand, has both immediate and long-term negative consequences on your financial goals. Some companies have limited sick days, which means a loss of income once paid days are used up. Obesity and other dietary illnesses make insurance premiums skyrocket, and poor health may force early retirement with lower monthly income for the rest of your life.\\n\\nWhat Is Financial Freedom? Everyone defines financial freedom in terms of their own goals. For most people, it means having the financial cushion (savings, investments, and cash) to afford a certain lifestyle—plus a nest egg for retirement or the freedom to pursue any career without the need to earn a certain salary.\\n\\nWhat Is the 50/30/20 Budget Rule? The 50/30/20 budget rule, popularized by Senator Elizabeth Warren, is a guideline to achieve financial stability by dividing after-tax income into 3 categories of spending: 50% for needs, 30% for wants, and 20% for savings and paying down debt. We have built an easy-to-follow budgeting calculator to help you categorize and control your spending and saving—which is the essential first step toward financial freedom.\\n\\nWill a Bad Credit Score Make My Car Insurance Higher? Although some states—including California, Hawaii, Washington, Massachusetts, and Michigan—limit or prohibit the use of credit scores to determine auto insurance rates, many companies do use a credit-based scoring system to decide whether to insure you and how much you will pay.\\n\\nThe Bottom Line\\n\\nThese 12 steps won’t solve all your money problems, but they will help you develop the good habits that get you on the path to financial freedom. Simply making a plan with specific target amounts and dates reinforces your resolve to reach your goal and guards you against the temptation to overspend. Once you start to make real progress, relief from the constant pressure of escalating debt and the promise of a nest egg for retirement kick in as powerful motivators—and financial freedom is in your sights.\")),\n",

Both are bank accounts designed to keep your money safe. But a checking account is more for holding money for regular spending, while a savings account is designed for longer-term goals.\\n\\nLearn more about the difference between a checking account and a savings account.\\n\\nKey Takeaways Checking accounts, unlike savings accounts, are designed for everyday banking.\\n\\nSavings accounts tend to have higher interest rates than checking accounts.\\n\\nSavings accounts may limit your monthly withdrawals.\\n\\nMany online banks offer no- or low-fee checking accounts and better interest rates on savings accounts.\\n\\nInvestopedia / Alex Dos Diaz\\n\\nWhat Is a Checking Account?\\n\\nA checking account is an account held at a financial institution that allows you to make credit and debit transactions. These accounts can offer both a debit card and check-writing capabilities.\\n\\nWithdrawals can take the form of cash withdrawals made at a branch or an automated teller machine (ATM), as well as debit card purchases, checks, money orders, ACH transfers, and wire transfers. Similarly, deposits can be made by depositing cash, checks, or money orders at a branch or an ATM, as well as via mobile check deposit, automated clearing house (ACH) transfer, or wire transfer.\\n\\n“If you need to use funds for daily transactions, a checking account is the best way to do that,” John Bergquist, President at Lift Financial in South Jordan, Utah, said.\\n\\nA checking account is useful if you need to:\\n\\nPay bills electronically or via check\\n\\nMake purchases or ATM withdrawals using a linked debit card\\n\\nTransfer money to an account at a different bank electronically\\n\\nChecking accounts may or may not be interest-bearing. If it is, the money you deposit earns interest as long as it stays in your account. These accounts can be offered by brick-and-mortar banks, online banks, credit unions, and other financial institutions.\\n\\nWhat Is a Savings Account?\\n\\nA savings account is a deposit account that’s designed for holding funds that aren’t earmarked for everyday use. For example, you might open a savings account to grow your emergency fund, set aside money for a vacation, or build your down payment.\\n\\nLike checking accounts, savings accounts have different rates and are from different financial institutions like traditional banks, online banks, and credit unions.\\n\\nYou're more likely to earn higher interest with savings accounts. Banks pay savers an annual percentage yield (APY) as an incentive for depositing and keeping money in their savings accounts. The APY savers can earn isn’t uniform, however. It can vary from bank to bank. On average the national savings rate was 0.46% as of Aug. 19, 2024.\\n\\n“An online savings account is a much better option at almost 20 times higher a rate than the traditional checking account,” Bergquist says. “In fact, it’s even very similar to what you would earn when purchasing a 10-year Treasury bond.”\\n\\nOnline banks often have the capability to pass on higher interest rates to savers, owing to their lower overhead and operating costs. The rates can vary widely, but it’s not unthinkable to find high-yield online savings accounts from banks and credit unions earning an APY of up to 5.50%.\\n\\nIn addition to higher interest rates on savings, online banks may charge fewer fees. For example, a traditional bank may charge a monthly maintenance or minimum balance fee for a savings account. An online bank may not charge either of these fees.\\n\\nWithdrawal Limits on Checking and Savings Accounts\\n\\nAn advantage of checking accounts is that withdrawals are virtually unlimited. You could use your card multiple times a day to shop, make daily cash withdrawals, and pay your bills without being penalized. But that may not be the case with your savings account. This started with Regulation D, which was a rule imposed on banks by the Federal Reserve.\\n\\nAccording to Regulation D:\\n\\nShare savings accounts, savings accounts, and money market accounts (MMAs) were limited to a maximum of six withdrawals per month. Your account provider could charge excess withdrawal fees if you exceed the maximum number of withdrawals per month.\\n\\nTransactions that counted toward the limit included ACH withdrawals, overdraft transfers from savings to checking, transfers made via online banking or by phone, debit card point-of-sale (POS) transactions, and transfers or withdrawals made via fax.\\n\\nUnlimited withdrawals from savings accounts were allowed when made in person, via mailed request, or at an ATM.\\n\\nAlthough Regulation D withdrawal restrictions were lifted in April 2020, some financial institutions may still charge their customers excess withdrawal fees if they're made from a savings account. It's always a good idea to ask your bank or credit union for the rules about your savings account so you're not surprised with fees that you weren't expecting.\\n\\nShop around to get the best deal—one that fits your needs and lifestyle. For instance, if you're looking for a better return, some banks reward customer loyalty with higher rates if they open both a checking and savings account and link them together.\\n\\n\\n\\nChecking vs. Savings Accounts: Which Is Better?\\n\\nWhen comparing checking and savings accounts, you may find that one is better suited to your needs. In some cases, you may benefit most from using both. Here are some questions to consider when shopping around for a checking or savings account.\\n\\nWhat are the fees associated with the account? For example, is there a monthly maintenance fee?\\n\\nIs there a minimum balance requirement?\\n\\nDoes a savings account come with an ATM card or a debit card?\\n\\nAre there daily limits on ATM withdrawals for checking accounts?\\n\\nAre there daily limits on deposits for a checking or savings account?\\n\\nDoes the account earn interest, and, if so, what is the APY?\\n\\nYou should also check whether the bank offers any special perks for opening an account.\\n\\n“Banks are highly competitive in a ridiculously low-interest-rate environment, and there are occasional incentives that could make a checking or savings account more attractive,” O’Donnell says. For example, you may be able to join a debit card rewards or discount program that could save you money. Or you could take advantage of promotional deals for opening other accounts, such as a money market or certificate of deposit (CD).\\n\\nLastly, keep in mind the kind of access you need when it comes to banking. Whether you choose a checking or savings account, consider whether the bank offers the online and mobile banking tools you need to manage your money digitally, the number of ATM locations, and whether branch banking is available, if that’s something you occasionally use.\\n\\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\\n\\nHow Much Money Should You Have in Your Checking Account? How much you should have in your checking account depends on a few key factors. If your bank requires you to hold a minimum balance in your account, you should at least have that amount or you risk being hit with service charges that eat away at your balance. But it's always a good idea to keep at least one to three months' worth of expenses in your checking account. This ensures you have enough to cover your living expenses and bills in case of an emergency.\\n\\nWhat Do You Need to Open a Checking or Savings Account? There are several things you'll need before you can open a bank account of any kind, whether that's a checking or savings account. That's because the financial institution needs to verify your identity. This means you'll need a valid piece of government-issued identification, such as a passport or driver's license, proof of your address, or your Social Security number. If your bank has a deposit requirement, you'll have to bring that with you, too.\\n\\nWhich Savings Account Earns You the Most Interest? The interest rate on most savings accounts is fairly low. But that doesn't mean all is lost as there are several options available for higher rates—you just have to look. Consider tiered accounts that offer higher rates as you deposit more money. Another option is the high-yield savings account, which pays more when you deposit a higher balance, usually over $5,000. If that's not enough, you may want to open a money market account, which has the features of both a checking and savings account. This type of account uses the money you deposit to invest in other vehicles. But it's still highly liquid.\\n\\nHow Do You Choose a Savings Account? Savings accounts have several features to consider when choosing one for yourself. First, the interest rate will help you earn money. The higher the interest rate, the more you will earn. Compare the fees and withdrawal restrictions when shopping for a savings account.\\n\\nThe Bottom Line\\n\\nBoth checking accounts and savings accounts can be valuable tools in your financial life. While they both hold your money safely, they are designed for different purposes. With checking accounts, you can use your money to make convenient purchases. With savings accounts, you can earn some interest and keep your funds safe. Before you open a checking or savings account, compare different rates and terms to ensure you get the best account for you.\\n\\n\")),\n",

Your counselor will contact your creditors to gain their participation and may be able to get them to reduce your interest rates, lower your monthly payments, or waive their late fees. A counselor can also help you create a budget, reduce your expenses, and better manage your money.\\n\\nUnder a debt management plan, you’ll make just one monthly payment to the credit counseling agency rather than paying your creditors directly. The counseling agency will disburse the money to your creditors on your behalf, based on a payment schedule they set.\\n\\nDebt management plans require consistent monthly payments. They usually take three to five years to complete, and you must agree not to use or take on any additional credit during that time. You will likely have to close the credit cards that are part of the plan. At the end of your debt management plan, your accounts will be completely paid off, and you’ll be debt free.\\n\\nThe Pros and Cons of Debt Management Plans\\n\\nPros\\n\\nBecome debt-free within five years : Under a debt management plan, you typically pay off all of your existing accounts within five years.\\n\\n: Under a debt management plan, you typically pay off all of your existing accounts within five years.

Apple, with complete control over its hardware, makes Apple Pay available on iPhone models with Face ID and Touch ID (except the 5s), iPad models with Touch ID or Face ID, Apple Watch Series 1 and later, and Mac models with Touch ID.\\n\\nGoogle, on the other hand, opts for a more traditional PIN-based authentication system. This allows it to work on older hardware than Apple Pay does. Both can make online purchases straight from an app or website, automatically handling the entire checkout process with pre-filled defaults and only requiring PIN or Touch ID verification to complete the transaction.\\n\\nNote From an industry point of view, the most significant breakthrough that mobile payment systems offer is in their security, and here, Apple and Google both incorporate some beneficial protections.\\n\\nApple Wallet vs. Apple Pay\\n\\nThe differences here are similar to those that existed between Google Wallet and Google Pay, although Google Pay\\'s P2P payments are no longer available in the U.S. In this case, Apple Pay is the secure payment system offered on Apple\\'s products, and Apple Wallet is where you can digitally store your credit or debit cards so you can use them with Apple Pay, along with other tickets, passes, IDs, and more.\\n\\nApple Pay vs. Google Wallet for Teens\\' Use\\n\\nIf you\\'re a parent or guardian of a teenager who\\'s interested in access to a mobile payment option, Apple Wallet provides Apple Cash Family. As an adult, you can add family members younger than 18 under your own Apple Wallet, which allows you to add money to their account, lock their access to the account, choose to whom they can send money, and set up notifications whenever the young person makes a transaction.\\n\\nIn addition, Apple Cash Family comes closest to letting you use it like cash because most retailers popular with kids (such as movie theaters, grocery and clothing stores, and popular fast-food places like Taco Bell) accept Apple Pay.\\n\\nP2P payments via Google Pay are no longer available to U.S. users, but it used to be a component of Google Wallet. Kids of any age could be added by a parent to the parent\\'s own Google account, which allowed the adult to limit children\\'s spending to certain apps or types of purchases, as well as require parental preauthorization for any purchase that the child makes. Kids under 13 couldn\\'t make purchases using Google Assistant, the company\\'s artificial intelligence (AI)-powered virtual assistant app.\\n\\nGoogle Pay used to offer another feature for family use, Purchase Requests. This allowed kids to send a request to buy something to the adult supervising Google Pay\\'s use by the family, even without a family payment method set up. Then the family manager of the account could review and decide whether to make the purchase for their young person.\\n\\nSecurity Systems\\n\\nCredit card fraud remains a significant problem worldwide. As banks and retailers work to upgrade their platforms, mobile payment systems like Apple Pay and Google Wallet may allow the U.S. to leapfrog to the forefront of payment security.\\n\\nThough the two systems appear to be equally robust, the companies take different approaches that shape what their products can and can\\'t do.\\n\\nFor the consumer, the use of Touch ID versus personal identification (PIN) authentication is the most visible difference, but behind the scenes, there is a lot more happening. Most important is the fact that neither system reveals the user\\'s card details to the vendor.\\n\\nGoogle Security\\n\\nWith both systems, you provide your card details only once, during the initial setup. Google adopts an intermediary role and saves your card details on its servers. Google would then issue a virtual card to your device, the Google Pay virtual card.\\n\\nWhen the seller charged the virtual card, Google, in turn, charged your stored debit or credit card and is the only entity that ever sees your real card through this transaction.\\n\\nApple Security\\n\\nApple employs a different system known as tokenization. Here, when your card details are provided to the device, it contacts the issuing bank directly and, upon confirmation, receives a device- and card-specific token called the Device Account Number (DAN), which is stored on a secure chip on the device. The DAN structurally resembles a credit card number and is passed on to the merchant when any payment is made before getting authorized by the bank.\\n\\nDoes Apple Pay Charge Fees? No, Apple Pay doesn\\'t charge consumers fees. Instead, it makes money directly from the bank that issued the card linked to the Apple Pay account.\\n\\nDoes Google Wallet Charge Fees? No, Google Wallet doesn\\'t charge consumers fees. Google makes money by charging vendors a percentage of each transaction, as well as through targeted ads.\\n\\nDoes Apple Pay Offer a Credit Line? Apple Pay doesn\\'t have its own credit line but pairs with the Apple Credit Card.\\n\\nDid Google Pay Offer a Credit Line? No, when it was available Google Pay didn\\'t offer a credit line in the U.S. As of June 4, 2024, Google Pay\\'s P2P payments are no longer available in the U.S.\\n\\nThe Bottom Line\\n\\nApple Pay was once promoted as \"Your wallet. Without the wallet,\" a description that, in truth, fits Google Wallet better. Google Pay, meanwhile, was promoted as \"an easier way to pay,\" which in all fairness is what Apple ought to be saying. For the consumer, both systems offered convenience and a measure of security, so choosing between the two was mostly a matter of personal preference.')),\n",

Individuals can borrow student debt through the government or private sources, such as banks and other lenders. Some lenders require payments while the student attends school, while others allow borrowers to begin repayment after they graduate.\\n\\n\\n\\nKey Takeaways Student debt is money borrowed by individuals to cover the cost of education.\\n\\nLoans can come from private or federally funded sources.\\n\\nDebt can be incurred to cover tuition, textbooks, miscellaneous fees, and room and board.\\n\\nThe first federal student loan payments since the pandemic were due on Oct. 1, 2023.\\n\\n\\n\\nSchool Expenses\\n\\nStudent debt is commonly used to cover the cost of education and other expenses. Students may use loans to pay for a wide variety of costs, including:\\n\\nTuition amounts not covered through a student\\'s assets, grants, parent loans, or scholarships\\n\\nHousing\\n\\nBooks and supplies\\n\\nAdministrative fees\\n\\nAdvanced degrees\\n\\n\\n\\nRepaying Debt\\n\\nWhile it is possible for students to save money to put toward the cost of higher education, the price at many institutions narrows the plausibility of covering such costs without some form of financial assistance. Students might take out student loans with the help of a parent, and depending on the type of loan, the parent may also be responsible for repayment.\\n\\nWhile there is an expectation that students will pursue careers that offer them the means to repay student debt over time, there are no guarantees that they will immediately find this kind of employment after they graduate. Student debt differs from other types of debt in that it typically cannot be discharged in bankruptcy except in cases of undue hardship.\\n\\nAccording to The 2022 Investopedia Financial Literacy Survey, 74% of millennials are seriously stressed about their financial circumstances. Borrowing and managing debt was the second-largest concern of surveyed millennials.\\n\\nThe COVID-19 moratorium on student loan payments and interest has come to an end. The accrual of both compound and simple interest resumed on Sept. 1, 2023, while the first student loan payments since the pandemic were due on Oct. 1, 2023.\\n\\nStudent Loan Forgiveness\\n\\nGraduates with federal student loan debt who qualify for special repayment plans, such as income-based repayment, may also qualify for debt forgiveness if they meet the following criteria:\\n\\nThose employed by a government or not-for-profit organization may be able to receive loan forgiveness under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) Program.\\n\\nIndividuals who teach full-time for five complete and consecutive academic years in a low-income elementary school, secondary school, or educational service agency may be eligible for forgiveness of up to $17,500 on your direct loan or FFEL Program loans.\\n\\nIf a university or school closes while enrolled, students may be eligible for the discharge of their federal student loan.\\n\\nAny relief mentioned in this article applies to federal student loans. Those with private student loans must check with the loan provider for repayment assistance.\\n\\nDebt Relief Programs\\n\\nIn August 2022, the Biden administration attempted to cancel up to $20,000 in student loan debt for borrowers with Pell Grants and $10,000 for other borrowers at a cost of $430 billion. On June 30, 2023, the Supreme Court struck down this plan in a 6-3 decision. The justices in the majority found the forgiveness program overstepped the bounds of federal law and usurped the power of Congress to control government spending.\\n\\nIn response to the decision, the White House unveiled the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) plan, a new income-driven repayment (IDR) option for borrowers. The SAVE plan reduces monthly payments to 5% of discretionary income for undergraduate borrowers. It also changes the discretionary income formula so that an estimated one million low-income borrowers will have their payments set at $0 per month. Furthermore, unpaid interest is no longer added to student loan balances, ensuring the amount you owe will not grow as long as payments are kept up to date. Another measure under SAVE provides loan forgiveness after 10 years for those with balances of $12,000 or less.\\n\\n\\n\\nOn July 18, 2024, a federal appeals court blocked the SAVE plan until two court cases centered around the IDR plan can be resolved. The Department of Education has moved borrowers enrolled in the SAVE plan into an interest-free forbearance while the litigation is ongoing. It has also outlined options for borrowers who were nearing PSLF—borrowers can either \"buy back\" months of PSLF credit if they reach 120 months of payments while in forbearance or switch to a different IDR plan.\\n\\nIs All Student Debt Eligible for Forgiveness? Only debt borrowed directly from the federal government is eligible for forgiveness. The Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program offers forgiveness for those who work for federal, state, local, or tribal governments or not-for-profit organizations. After making 120 qualifying payments in an income-driven repayment program while working full-time in a qualifying position, the remainder of the debt will be forgiven.\\n\\n\\n\\nWho Manages Federal Student Loans? When you take out a federal student loan, the Department of Education will assign your loan to a service provider once the first disbursement is made. These loan servicers are the point of contact for questions about your loan and arranging payment options. These providers include Edfinancial, MOHELA, Aidvantage, Nelnet, ECSI, and Default Resolution Group. Older loans made under the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program are not owned by the Department of Education department and may be serviced by Aidvantage.\\n\\nCan Student Debt be Dissolved Through Bankruptcy? In all but the rarest situations, no. Student debt stays with the student until the loans are repaid or forgiven, even in the case of bankruptcy.\\n\\nWhat Happens to My Student Debt if I Don\\'t Graduate? All student loans must be repaid, regardless of graduation status. For most federal student loans, repayment starts six months after the student leaves college or drops below half-time enrollment.\\n\\nThe Bottom Line\\n\\nStudent debt is common in an era of high-priced higher education. There are many funding sources for student debt, including state loans, private loans, and federal loans, but only federal loans qualify for income-based repayment plans or forgiveness. Incoming students will be at a greater advantage by lowering their debt through work-study, working outside of school, or choosing an affordable school, as paying down debt can take decades and affect how much of your monthly salary you have left for your long-term financial goals.')),\n",

Before locking down a home loan, be sure to compare the best mortgage rates today, too.\\n\\nKey Takeaways Home loan types include conventional loans and government loans such as Federal Housing Administration (FHA), U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) loans.\\n\\nOther mortgage products include jumbo mortgages for expensive properties and interest-only mortgages for borrowers who expect their income to increase significantly after signing.\\n\\nTypically, lenders structure mortgage terms as 15-year or 30-year loans.\\n\\nMortgages can have fixed rates, which stay the same for the length of the loan, or variable rates, which change based on a benchmark interest rate.\\n\\nMortgage Terms and Rates\\n\\nBefore you consider which type of mortgage is right for you, it's helpful to understand a few basic facts about how mortgages work. Mortgage terms refer to the length of the loan. Mortgage interest rates can be fixed or variable, meaning they may stay the same or change based on a benchmark interest rate. Within each type of mortgage, the length and rate type can vary.\\n\\nMortgage Terms\\n\\nThe most common mortgage terms are 30-year and 15-year. The term of your mortgage equals how long it will take you to pay it off if you pay the exact minimum amount every month. A 15-year mortgage breaks your loan and interest payments into 180 equal payments. A 30-year mortgage equals out to 360 payments.\\n\\nRegardless of which loan term you choose, as long as your mortgage doesn’t include a prepayment penalty, you can choose to make additional principal payments to pay off your mortgage faster without refinancing.\\n\\nFixed-Rate vs. Adjustable-Rate Mortgages\\n\\nA fixed-rate mortgage is a mortgage where your interest rate is fixed for the entire term of your loan. If you closed on a 30-year mortgage on Jan. 1, 2022, at an interest rate of 2.99%, and you never move, refinance, or make additional payments, then your interest rate will still be 2.99% when you make your final payment on Jan. 1, 2052. A mortgage calculator can show you the impact of different rates on your monthly payment.\\n\\nConversely, an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) has a rate that changes at set periods of time. Common mortgage ARMs include 7/1 and 5/1, but technically, any ARM term is possible. On a 7/1 ARM, the rate remains the same for the first seven years and is then adjusted every single year thereafter.\\n\\nARMs became very popular prior to the subprime mortgage crisis because they offered lower initial payments, but then they led to a wave of foreclosures as the rates increased and made mortgage payments unaffordable for thousands of Americans. ARMs are risky for most borrowers and are generally not a great choice unless you intend to pay off your mortgage or refinance before your rate adjusts.\\n\\n\\n\\nConventional Mortgages\\n\\nConventional mortgages are the most common mortgage type. These loans are offered by most lenders through Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which are government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs). They are distinct from mortgages guaranteed by government agencies such as the Federal Housing Administration. Generally, conventional mortgages have stricter requirements than government-backed mortgages.\\n\\nWho are conventional mortgages best for?\\n\\nConventional mortgages are best for well-qualified buyers who don’t fall into a specific population to be eligible for special government-backed financing.\\n\\nRequirements\\n\\nCredit score of 620+\\n\\nAt least 3% for a down payment (private mortgage insurance [PMI] will be required if putting less than 20% down)\\n\\nVerifiable income for 2+ years\\n\\nDebt-to-income (DTI) ratio of 43% or less\\n\\nPros and Cons of Conventional Mortgages Pros Can be used to finance primary residences or investment properties\\n\\nOffers down payments as low as 3%\\n\\nNo PMI requirement for down payments of 20% and over Cons Higher credit score requirements than FHA loans\\n\\nStricter DTI ratio requirements than FHA loans\\n\\nPMI still required for lower down payments\\n\\nGovernment-Backed Mortgage Programs\\n\\nOver the years, the U.S. government has created numerous special home-buying programs to encourage rural development, help revitalize low-income neighborhoods, and help veterans become homeowners.\\n\\nUSDA Loans\\n\\nU.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) loans were originally created to help provide mortgages in rural areas lacking development. They are a unique and extremely attractive option for those who qualify because they allow borrowers to put 0% down and do not require any form of private mortgage insurance (PMI).\\n\\nRequirements\\n\\nThe property must be in an area designated as rural by the USDA.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe borrower’s household income has to meet eligibility limits.\\n\\nThe borrower’s DTI ratio must be as high as 41%, with some exceptions.\\n\\nThe borrower’s credit score must be 620 or higher, with some exceptions.\\n\\nPros and Cons of USDA Loans Pros No down payment required\\n\\nAvailable for low- and moderate-income buyers\\n\\nNot restricted to first-time home buyers Cons Property must be located in a USDA-designated rural area\\n\\nCan only be used for primary residences\\n\\nBorrowers must have a DTI ratio of 41% or better\\n\\nFHA Loans\\n\\nFederal Housing Administration (FHA) loans are loans insured by the FHA but issued by any FHA-approved lender. FHA loans differ from HUD loans, which apply only to unique circumstances like Section 184 for Native Americans.\\n\\nIn general, FHA loans exist to help low-income borrowers buy homes and have more lax income, credit score, and down payment requirements. FHA loans tend to have higher interest rates and fees than conventional mortgages and require an up-front mortgage insurance premium equal to 1.75% of the loan amount as of 2024, in addition to an annual mortgage insurance premium.\\n\\nWho are FHA loans best for?\\n\\nFHA loans are best for individuals who can’t qualify for other home loans because other options tend to be much cheaper upfront and over the life of the loan.\\n\\nRequirements\\n\\nCredit score as low as either 500 with 10% down or 580 with 3.5% down\\n\\nDown payments as low as 3.5%\\n\\nVerifiable income for 2+ years\\n\\nDTI ratio of 43% or less\\n\\n\\n\\nPros and Cons of FHA Loans Pros Credit score requirements of 500+ for some borrowers\\n\\nLow down payment requirement of 3.5%\\n\\nLess stringent income requirements Cons Borrowers with lower credit scores must make higher down payments\\n\\nOther mortgage options may be cheaper for well-qualified borrowers\\n\\nFHA loans require mortgage insurance for every borrower\\n\\nVA Loans\\n\\nU.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) loans are similar to FHA loans. They are backed by the VA, and are issued by VA-approved lenders according to VA-mandated guidelines. They are similar to USDA loans in that they do not require a down payment or mortgage insurance. They offer competitive interest rates and have more lax requirements than conventional mortgages. Borrowers generally have to be veterans who have served for certain lengths of time or under specific circumstances.\\n\\n\\n\\nRequirements\\n\\nBorrowers must have a Certificate of Eligibility from the VA, which they can apply for here.\\n\\nThe VA does not set a minimum credit score, but lenders generally look for minimum scores of 620 or higher.\\n\\nDTI ratio of 41% or less\\n\\nDown payment as low as 0%\\n\\nVerifiable income for 2+ years, with some exceptions\\n\\n\\n\\nPros and Cons of VA Loans Pros No down payment needed\\n\\nFlexible credit requirements\\n\\nCompetitive interest rates\\n\\nNo mortgage insurance required Cons Available only to veterans and active military who meet requirements\\n\\nCan only use for a primary residence, with a few exceptions\\n\\nProperty must meet VA guidelines\\n\\nGetting ready to buy your first home? We’ve created a guide to walk you through each step so you can make smart financial decisions in an unprecedented market. Check out “Owning It: How To Buy a House“ to learn more.\\n\\nOther Unique Mortgage Products\\n\\nJumbo Mortgages\\n\\nJumbo mortgages are loans for amounts that exceed the limits on conventional mortgages set by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) and are typically issued on luxury properties or in areas with exceptionally high housing costs.\\n\\n\\n\\nWho are jumbo mortgages best for?\\n\\nJumbo mortgages are best for well-qualified buyers purchasing expensive properties who don’t qualify for conventional mortgages and don’t have the cash or assets to buy a property outright. Collectively, these borrowers are referred to as HENRYs (High Earners, Not Rich Yet).\\n\\nRequirements\\n\\nCredit score of 740+\\n\\nDown payment of at least 10%, 20% preferred\\n\\nTwo+ years of verifiable income history\\n\\nDTI ratio under 45%\\n\\n\\n\\nInterest-Only Mortgages\\n\\nInterest-only mortgages mean that borrowers only pay the interest portion of their loan for a set period of time. The borrower gains zero equity in the home during these payments and will need to pay off the mortgage either in a lump sum or with significantly increased payments in the future depending on the terms of the loan.\\n\\n\\n\\nWho are interest-only mortgages best for?\\n\\n\\n\\nInterest-only mortgages are best for individuals who have assets tied up that will become available soon, who receive significant periodic bonuses with which to pay down the principal, or who can expect their income to increase significantly before the principal payments become due (such as a medical student about to graduate and who has a signed employment contract).\\n\\nRequirements\\n\\nInterest-only mortgages are a niche specialty product with no set requirements. Expect to have to show substantial assets and documentation proving your future ability to meet the payments when they increase.\\n\\nShould I get a Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loan or a conventional loan? A conventional loan is cheaper upfront and in the long term than a Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loan, as long as you can be approved for a conventional loan.\\n\\nShould I get a U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) loan or a conventional loan? If you are able to get a U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) loan, you can pay better rates with lower fees and less money down, which makes it a better choice for most borrowers over a conventional loan.\\n\\nHow much money should I put down? If you have a large chunk of cash just sitting around, then putting 20% down will save you any mortgage insurance premiums and make you a more qualified buyer, getting you the best rates. With current mortgage rates as low as they are, any cash over 20% down could most likely perform better in a retirement savings vehicle like an individual retirement account (IRA), a 401(k), or a Health Savings Account (HSA) and give you immediate tax savings.\\n\\nThe Bottom Line\\n\\nConventional, fixed-rate mortgages are the most popular home loan type because they offer the most competitive rates and fees and are easy to find. For people who can’t qualify for a conventional mortgage, FHA loans, VA loans, and USDA loans can help lower-income buyers with fair or better credit to become homeowners. Additionally, VA loans and USDA loans have attractive terms and perks for those who qualify for them. Regardless of which loan type you end up choosing, be sure to calculate how a mortgage payment can fit into your overall budget and consider whether buying a home is the right choice for you.\")),\n",

Today, we can almost feel nostalgic remembering the good old days when DJIA losses were measured in hundreds, instead of thousands.\\n\\nIn 2020, when the U.S. first realized the seriousness of the economic crisis and lockdown—and that a recession was likely unavoidable—the markets sustained epic losses that make the 2008 financial crisis look like small potatoes. The stock market crash of 2020, as it\\'s now called, started on March 9 when the Dow fell 2,013.76 points—a 7.79% drop.\\n\\nOn March 11, the Dow lost 1,464.94 points to close 20.3% down from its Feb. 12 high, signaling a bear market and the end of the 11-year bull market that began in March 2009. On March 12, the Dow dropped another 2,352.6 points (9.99%). On March 16, the Dow lost 2,997.10 points (12.93%). Throughout 2020 and into 2021 the markets rebounded as optimism about vaccines and a global economic recovery took hold. But an event like the 2020 crisis shows that bear markets can arise, even amidst an otherwise healthy economy.\\n\\nWe never know when an emergency will strike—whether it\\'s a hurricane, earthquake, or your own changing financial or medical situation. It pays to have a plan in place that can help get you and your loved ones through the crisis.\\n\\nIt\\'s never too late to work on emergency-proofing your finances.\\n\\nFinancial Health\\n\\nIt\\'s easier to respond and adapt to an emergency when you\\'re prepared. For starters, take a look at your financial health. Pay attention to your income, savings, investments, net worth, and debt. If you\\'re like most people, you have room for improvement when it comes to your financial health. Here are a few things to work on:\\n\\nMake a budget and stick to it. People usually know how much money they have coming in, but it can be a shock to see where your money goes. Find ways to cut your costs, if possible. Think: Do I really need that? Do I have something already that I could use instead? Do I want this more than I want to be financially stable?\\n\\nSave and invest a certain percentage of your income every month. Put it in your budget to help make it happen, and review your progress each year. Even though it\\'s never too late to start, your money has more time to grow if you start early. And remember, economic downturns are temporary. Think long-term, and do not panic. Be convinced that the best times to invest even more are these times. If you have extra money invest it and most importantly do not sell your investments at those times.\\n\\nOrganize your important documents so you know where to find them in an emergency. Consider putting your hard-to-replace documents, collectibles, and heirlooms in a safe deposit box. Since you can\\'t access a safe deposit box 24/7, however, don\\'t put anything in it that you might need in a hurry—such as a passport or the only copy of a living will, advanced medical directive, or durable power of attorney.\\n\\nImprove your credit score. During a recession, lenders favor the strongest borrowers. You will have access to better terms and rates if you have a higher credit score.\\n\\nDesignate a financial power of attorney who can make financial decisions on your behalf if you\\'re physically or mentally unable to handle your affairs.\\n\\nEmergency Fund\\n\\nFinancial planners recommend that you should set aside three to six months\\' worth of living expenses in an emergency fund. If you\\'re able to, it\\'s a good idea to save even more. Keep in mind that your emergency fund should be used only in a true emergency—such as to make ends meet when you\\'re unemployed, recovering from a natural disaster, or need to pay medical bills.\\n\\nFast Cash\\n\\nIf you don\\'t have an emergency fund—or you\\'ve already burned through it—you might need to raise some cash as quickly as possible. Here are several options for doing so:\\n\\nGo through your home and garage to find things you can sell. Post your items on an online marketplace, such as Facebook, eBay, ThredUp, OfferUp, LetGo—or hold a yard sale.\\n\\nPost your items on an online marketplace, such as Facebook, eBay, ThredUp, OfferUp, LetGo—or hold a yard sale. Borrow from your retirement account. You may be able to take a short-term loan from your 401(k)—and do your best to pay it back on time. The maximum amount you may borrow from your 401(k) plan is either 50% of your vested balance or $50,000, whichever is less.\\n\\nBorrow from friends or family. This one is tricky because it can put a strain on relationships. Be careful what you promise and always follow through.\\n\\nEarn extra cash. Work extra hours at your existing job if it still exists, ask for that long-awaited raise, or find a side hustle. With working from home on the rise, many job sites, such as FlexJobs, advertise flexible hours, remote contracts, or part-time jobs. Websites like Upwork and Freelancer have abundant freelance gigs for many skills. So does TaskRabbit.\\n\\nAny funds you borrow from your 401(k) lose the benefit of tax-deferred growth on earnings.\\n\\nDebt Management\\n\\nIt\\'s a lot easier to face an emergency if you don\\'t have a lot of debt. Good debt has the potential to increase your net worth—such as borrowing for college, a home, or a small business. Bad debt is when you borrow to buy something that doesn\\'t increase in value or generate income, including cars, clothes, and most credit card debt. Whether you\\'re facing an emergency or not, it\\'s always a good idea to avoid bad debt, as much as possible. Still, if you can\\'t pay your bills due to an emergency, you may be able to:\\n\\nTake out a low-interest loan to consolidate higher-interest debt.\\n\\nAsk for debt settlement, in which a lender forgives part of your debt.\\n\\nAsk your lender about debt relief programs.\\n\\nInsurance Coverage\\n\\nInsurance is an essential part of emergency planning. Review your insurance (including property, health, life, car, and umbrella policies) to make sure you have the right amount of coverage and to make changes, if necessary. Look at whether you should buy disability insurance to help replace earned income, should you become too disabled to work.\\n\\nYou may be able to save money on your premiums by taking advantage of any available discounts, such as for bundling your car and property insurance. It\\'s a good idea to call your insurance provider once a year (for instance, when you get your renewal notice in the mail) to make sure you\\'re not missing out on any deals.\\n\\nHealthcare\\n\\nMaking sure you have adequate health insurance is only one aspect of your overall healthcare. To prepare for emergencies, it\\'s essential that you also have a medical power of attorney, a legal document that gives one person the power to act for or, on behalf of, someone else.\\n\\nAlso important: Anyone over age 18 must give written permission for someone else to receive medical information about them—even if the other adult is a parent. You\\'ll need a medical power of attorney to make decisions on your adult child\\'s behalf if they become incapacitated. So, in addition to making sure you have assigned that power to someone in case something happens to you, be sure both adult children and other adults in your family have these documents in place.\\n\\nMake a Will\\n\\nAlong with a medical (and a financial) power of attorney, everyone needs a will, even if you\\'re a long way from being old. A will is a legal document that sets forth your wishes. If you die without a will, your wishes may not be carried out and, when your estate goes into probate, a court will be in charge and additional fees will likely be imposed.\\n\\nA living will is a separate document (and also important). It sets forth your wishes for medical care if you become incapacitated, including whether you want to be resuscitated or if life support should be used to prolong your life.\\n\\nWhen Disaster Strikes\\n\\nAny emergency is disruptive and difficult, even when you\\'re prepared for it. But if you haven\\'t planned, it can be even more challenging. Emergencies—whether natural disasters, illnesses, or recessions—are all but inevitable, so it makes sense to prepare for them as best as you can. That way, you may be able to lessen the disruption, reduce your stress, and be in a better position to ride out the crisis.')),\n",
       " GraphDocument(nodes=[], relationships=[], source=Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"Exchange-Traded Funds Mutual Funds Stocks Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are a type of index funds that track a basket of securities. Mutual funds are pooled investments into bonds, securities, and other instruments. Stocks are securities that provide returns based on performance. ETF prices can trade at a premium or at a loss to the net asset value (NAV) of the fund. Mutual fund prices trade at the net asset value of the overall fund. Stock returns are based on their actual performance in the markets. ETFs are traded in the markets during regular hours, just like stocks are. Mutual funds can be redeemed only at the end of a trading day. Stocks are traded during regular market hours. Some ETFs can be purchased commission-free and are cheaper than mutual funds because they do not charge marketing fees. Some mutual funds do not charge load fees, but most are more expensive than ETFs because they charge administrative and marketing fees. Stocks can be purchased commission-free on some platforms and generally do not have charges associated with them after purchase. ETFs do not involve actual ownership of securities. Mutual funds own the securities in their basket. Stocks involve physical ownership of the security. ETFs diversify risk by creating a portfolio that can span multiple asset classes, sectors, industries, and security instruments. Mutual funds diversify risk by creating a portfolio that can span multiple asset classes, sectors, industries, and security instruments. Risk is concentrated in a stock’s performance. ETF trading generally occurs in-kind, meaning they are not redeemed for cash. Mutual fund shares can be redeemed for money at the fund’s net asset value for that day. Stocks are bought and sold using cash. Because ETF share exchanges are usually treated as in-kind distributions, ETFs are the most tax-efficient among all three types of financial instruments. Mutual funds offer tax benefits when they return capital or include certain types of tax-exempt bonds in their portfolio. Stocks are taxed at either ordinary income tax rates or capital gains rates.\\n\\nActive vs. Passive Equity Funds\\n\\nDividends and Taxes\\n\\nThough ETFs allow investors to gain as stock prices rise and fall, they also benefit from companies that pay dividends. Dividends are a portion of earnings allocated or paid by companies to investors for holding their stock. ETF shareholders are entitled to a proportion of the profits, such as earned interest or dividends paid, and may get a residual value if the fund is liquidated.\\n\\nAn ETF is more tax-efficient than a mutual fund because most buying and selling occur through an exchange, and the ETF sponsor does not need to redeem shares each time an investor wishes to sell or issue new shares each time an investor wishes to buy.\\n\\nRedeeming shares of a fund can trigger a tax liability, so listing the shares on an exchange can keep tax costs lower. In the case of a mutual fund, each time an investor sells their shares, they sell it back to the fund and incur a tax liability that must be paid by the shareholders of the fund.\\n\\nCreation and Redemption\\n\\nThe supply of ETF shares is regulated through creation and redemption, which involves large specialized investors called authorized participants (APs). When an ETF wants to issue additional shares, the AP buys shares of the stocks from the index—such as the S&P 500 tracked by the fund—and sells or exchanges them to the ETF for new ETF shares at an equal value. In turn, the AP sells the ETF shares in the market for a profit.\\n\\nWhen an AP sells stocks to the ETF sponsor in return for shares in the ETF, the block of shares used in the transaction is called a creation unit. If an ETF closes with a share price of $101 and the value of the stocks that the ETF owns is only worth $100 on a per-share basis, then the fund’s price of $101 was traded at a premium to the fund’s net asset value (NAV). The NAV is an accounting mechanism that determines the overall value of the assets or stocks in an ETF.\\n\\nConversely, an AP also buys shares of the ETF on the open market. The AP then sells these shares back to the ETF sponsor in exchange for individual stock shares that the AP can sell on the open market. As a result, the number of ETF shares is reduced through the process called redemption. The amount of redemption and creation activity is a function of demand in the market and whether the ETF is trading at a discount or premium to the value of the fund’s assets.\\n\\nETFs in the United Kingdom\\n\\nThe U.K. ETF market is one of the largest and most diverse in Europe, with ETFs listed on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) that offer exposure to various asset classes and markets, including equities, fixed income, commodities, currencies, real estate, and alternative investments.\\n\\nBuying ETFs in the U.K. allows inclusion in Individual Savings Accounts (ISAs), which are tax-efficient savings vehicles that allow investors to invest up to £20,000 per year without paying any income or capital gains tax on their returns. Another benefit is that ETFs attract no stamp duty, which is a tax levied on ordinary share transactions in the U.K.\\n\\n\\n\\nU.K. investors can buy shares in U.S.-listed companies from the U.K., but due to local and European regulations, you're not allowed to purchase U.S.-listed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.K. There are U.K.-based ETFs that track U.S. markets, as long as it has the 'UCITS' moniker in the name. This means the fund is fully regulated in the U.K. and allowed to track U.S. investments.For broad-based exposure to U.K. equities, there are several UCITS ETFs that track the FTSE 100 index, which consists of the 100 largest publicly listed companies in the country. The HSBC FTSE UCITS ETF is listed on the London Stock Exchange and trades under the ticker symbol HUKX. The ETF has an ongoing charge of 0.07% and a dividend yield of 3.62% as of January 2024.\\n\\nWhat Was the First Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF)? The distinction of being the first exchange-traded fund (ETF) is often given to the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) launched by State Street Global Advisors on Jan. 22, 1993. There were, however, some precursors to the SPY, notably securities called Index Participation Units listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) that tracked the Toronto 35 Index that appeared in 1990.\\n\\nHow Is an ETF Different From an Index Fund? An index fund usually refers to a mutual fund that tracks an index. An index ETF is constructed in much the same way and will hold the stocks of an index, tracking it. However, the difference between an index fund and an ETF is that an ETF tends to be more cost-effective and liquid than an index mutual fund. You can also buy an ETF from a broker who will execute the trade throughout the trading day, while a mutual fund trades via a broker only at the close of each trading day.\\n\\nDo ETFs Provide Diversity? Nearly all ETFs provide diversification benefits relative to an individual stock purchase. Still, some ETFs are highly concentrated—either in the number of different securities they hold or in the weighting of those securities. For example, a fund that concentrates half of its assets in two or three positions may offer less diversification than a fund with fewer total portfolio constituents but broader asset distribution.\\n\\nThe Bottom Line\\n\\nExchange-traded funds represent a cost-effective way to gain exposure to a broad basket of securities with a limited budget. Investors can build a portfolio that holds one, many, or only ETFs. Instead of buying individual stocks, investors buy shares of a fund that targets a representative cross-section of the wider market. However, there are some additional expenses to keep in mind when investing in an ETF.\")),\n",

These loans allows you to buy something today with the program, then repay the amount over time with regular, interest-free installments. But how do they compare to credit cards?\\n\\nMuch depends on your age, whether you want to build credit history, can manage loans without getting into trouble, and whether you will read the fine print. Here's how buy-now-pay-later compares to paying with a credit card.\\n\\nKey Takeaways Buy-now-pay-later plans allow you to make purchases and pay for them in several (often four) installments.\\n\\nCredit cards also let consumers pay over time, but only the monthly minimum payment is required.\\n\\nBoth types of payments require users to be at least 18 years old.\\n\\nBNPL plans can be easier and quicker to get than credit cards and they often charge no interest, but they can have confusing consumer terms.\\n\\nCredit cards can offer clear consumer language, and rewards in the form of cash back, airline miles, or points on purchases, which BNPL loans do not.\\n\\nWhat Is Buy Now, Pay Later?\\n\\nBuy now, pay later is a type of short-term installment loan accepted by major retailers and online stores. Companies offering BNPL plans include\\n\\nEach buy-now-pay-later plan is unique, but generally you'll find a few things in common.\\n\\nMany BNPL companies only perform a soft credit check to approve shoppers for loans. That means applying won't hurt your credit score. (But be sure to check—some providers do perform a hard pull, especially for longer-term plans.)\\n\\nBNPLs can have very low requirements to qualify—but for most, borrowers must be 18, have a mobile phone number, a debit or credit card for repayment, and the company must be able to verify your identity.\\n\\nRepayment of the loan could take a few weeks or a few months. Many BNPL services set the total number of payments at four, while others allow borrowers to select their payment schedule. Usually, no interest is charged for the repayment plan, but it depends on the provider.\\n\\nBNPL may charge fees including:\\n\\nLate fees\\n\\nNon-sufficient funds (NSF) fees\\n\\nService fees for each payment\\n\\nAccount reactivation fee\\n\\nRescheduled payment fee\\n\\nAs you repay the original amount borrowed, the BNPL provider can replenish your available credit. So if you borrowed $500 and then paid off $500, then the provider could make another $500 loan available to you for spending.\\n\\nExample of BNPL Use\\n\\nYou want to buy a $100 shirt, and at checkout you are offered a BNPL loan. If approved, BNPL loans typically require an upfront deposit payment, such as 25% of the purchase amount. To find the required deposit, you multiply the total by 0.25. As an example, for that $100 shirt, the BNPL plan would require a deposit of $25.\\n\\nThe remaining $75 must be paid off in regular installments, typically through automated payments. For example, you may have three more payments of $25 each charged to your debit or credit card over the next three weeks.\\n\\n\\n\\nLate fees are often around $7 per missed BNPL payment, on an average loan size of $135, according to a 2022 Consumer Financial Protection Bureau report.\\n\\nHow Credit Cards Work vs. BNPL\\n\\nCompared to BNPL plans, applying for a credit card takes longer, but credit cards come with some protections that BNPL plans lack.\\n\\nWhen you pay for something with a credit card, if you don't pay it off by the due date on your credit card statement, you will be charged interest on the unpaid balance. Teens and young adults often use the following credit card types:\\n\\nLike with BNPL loans, you must be 18 to apply for a credit card. But federal law requires credit card companies to be more strict about offering a card to people under age 21. The card company must perform a hard credit check and determine your ability to pay based on your income. If you don't yet have a steady source of income, you may not qualify or need to ask an adult to be your cosigner.\\n\\nThere can be exceptions. You may not qualify for a student credit card if you don't yet have any income, for example. But you might be eligible for a secured credit card.\\n\\nSecured cards require you to put down a deposit when you're approved, and then that becomes your spending limit. So it's much harder to run up a balance you can't pay, but you're still building credit, which can help you get future loans and better credit cards.\\n\\nParents can add teens under 18 as authorized users. A teen can build credit history depending on how the card reports authorized users to the credit agencies.\\n\\nOnce you're approved for a credit card, it still may take several days or even weeks for the physical card to show up in the mail. So, they usually won't fill an immediate purchase need in the way a BNPL plan can if you don't already have the card.\\n\\n\\n\\nLike buy-now-pay-later loans, credit cards can be used at online and physical stores. But credit cards can also be used to purchase gasoline, make utility bill payments, and pay for other expenses. They are accepted by a majority of retailers.\\n\\nCredit cards also charge fees:\\n\\nExample of Credit Card Use\\n\\nTo illustrate how a credit card works, say you get a credit card with a 20% annual percentage rate (APR) and buy a $100 shirt. At the end of the month, you can either pay the $100 and not owe any interest or pay the $25 minimum payment and owe interest on the remaining $75.\\n\\nIf you pay only the minimum, next month, you can pay either $75 + $1.50 (in interest) or the minimum payment. If you pay only the minimum, you will be charged interest again on the balance. The accumulation of interest payments can make using a credit card expensive in the long-term.\\n\\nBuy Now, Pay Later vs. Credit Cards: Key Differences\\n\\nAge Restrictions\\n\\nBNPL plans are only available for teens of legal age in your state. Legal age is the age you're considered an adult, which is typically 18. You may need to be 19 years old if you live in Alabama or are a ward of the state in Nebraska.\\n\\nCredit cards—specifically secured credit cards or credit cards with a cosigner—are also only available for teens 18 and older, depending on state. But a teen can be added to an adult's credit card as an authorized user after age 13, depending on the issuer.\\n\\nAccess and Ease\\n\\nShort-term BNPL plans have a high approval rate. According to the CFPB, 69% of applicants between ages 18 and 24 are approved for BNPL loans. These loans may be a fit for those who've had trouble getting approved for a traditional credit card due to a low credit score or an insufficient credit history, or thin file.\\n\\nCredit cards are more difficult to get approved for than BNPL loans. Approval may depend on many factors, including your credit history and your ability to repay if you're under 21. Gen Z also has the lowest credit scores of all generations, which may be why they have the fewest credit cards (an average of around two cards) of all generations.\\n\\nUntil you build a credit history and good credit score, you may need to ask to be added as an authorized user on a parent's or guardian's card. Or you can ask someone with good credit to be a cosigner on your card.\\n\\nIf you are over 18 with no credit history, consider a secured credit card, which can help you build good credit with regular payments and learn to manage a credit card. If you're in school, you can also consider a student credit card, which has less strict approval terms but generally comes with a smaller credit limit.\\n\\nInterest and Fees\\n\\nIf you have a credit card and pay off your bill in full each month, you won't owe any interest payments. Otherwise, you will owe interest next month on the part of the bill you didn't pay.\\n\\nBuy-now-pay-later plans often have short-term repayment plans without interest and don't allow you to borrow as much as you could with a credit card. But BNPL plans may also offer longer-term repayment plans for larger amounts (for example, up to $10,000) that do charge interest.\\n\\nOne Harvard Business School study found that among people with lower incomes (those who earn $25,000 to $45,000 a year) who used BNPL, 20% wound up with overdraft fees, and 17% paid low-balance fees. So if you're using BNPL to stretch paychecks, be aware of the fees.\\n\\n\\n\\nCredit Impacts\\n\\nMost BNPL plans only perform a soft inquiry to approve you for credit. If you're hoping to build credit, know that most BNPL companies don't report to credit bureaus or do so consistently. But if you make late payments or if you don't repay the loan, some BNPL will report you to credit bureaus. Your credit score could go down.\\n\\nCredit cards, on the other hand, will perform a hard inquiry when you first apply. Then, they provide your borrowing and repayment information to credit reporting agencies. Paying your credit card bills on time and keeping your debt amounts low can help you earn a better credit score. On the other hand, missed payments and large credit card debts can hurt your credit score.\\n\\n\\n\\nProtections\\n\\nCredit cards give you more consumer protections than BNPL loans.\\n\\nThe Consumer Finance Protection Bureau found that credit card products are often more transparent with consumers than BNPL loans. It may be easier for you to find and understand terms for repayment, consequences for not paying bills on time, and ways to dispute charges.\\n\\nIn contrast, the BNPL loan's terms and fees may be more difficult to decipher. If you need to return something or report a wrong charge, you may find that BNPL services are not as easy to work with as credit card companies.\\n\\nDebt Problems\\n\\nCarrying credit card debt from month to month can impact long-term financial health.\\n\\nWhile BNPL users might sign up for services to avoid credit card debt, buy-now-pay-later can still lead to debt and credit problems, especially for young or anyone living beyond their means. This can happen when borrowers borrow too much or for too long.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn fact, Harvard Business School's study found that 45% of users rely on BNPL plans to make a purchase outside their budget, and often spend more than they would with a credit card.\\n\\nWhat Is the Minimum Age for BNPL? Buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) providers such as Klarna, Afterpay, and others require borrowers to be at least 18 years old. The BNPL approval process requires applicants to enter their birthdate. Many lenders ensure you've entered the correct birthdate by matching it with other information such as name and address.\\n\\nIs BNPL Replacing Credit Cards? According to C+R Research, 38% of survey respondents felt that buy-now-pay-later services would eventually replace their credit cards, and 56% preferred BNPL for purchases. But not all merchants work with BNPL services to offer plans, while you can use a Visa or Mastercard credit card at almost any merchant. BNPL also can't replace a credit card's flexibility and immediate use in an emergency.\\n\\nWhat Are the Disadvantages of Buy Now, Pay Later? The downsides of BNPL loans include: Sometimes-confusing or inconsistent terms, fees, and dispute resolution\\n\\nPayment plans aren't always interest-free and could require autopay\\n\\nThe potential to hold many buy-now-pay-later debts\\n\\nLate, partial, or non-payment could hurt your credit score, depending on the BNPL terms\\n\\nThe Bottom Line\\n\\nSaving up to buy something, or using a debit card or preloaded card to buy it may be better than using BNPL plans or credit cards for online shopping or other purchases you can't afford to pay for immediately in full.\\n\\n\\n\\nUsed responsibly, BNPL loans could be a good fit for those who want to avoid interest and don't yet have credit files. But they also may not help you build good credit, even if you regularly pay them on time. And any unpaid or late debts could damage your credit score. And piling up BNPL loans, even if you pay them on time, can be hard to manage.\\n\\nCredit cards can be a good option in you have regular income and can pay off the card every month.

Here we discuss five broad personal finance rules that can help get you on track to achieving whatever your financial goals may be.\\n\\nKey Takeaways “Personal finance” is too often an intimidating term that causes people to avoid planning, which can lead to bad decisions and poor outcomes.\\n\\nTake the time to budget your income vs. expenses, so you can spend within your means and manage lifestyle expectations.\\n\\nSuccessful financial planning entails being mindful of spending regardless of your income level or of what you want but don\\'t need.\\n\\nBy saving early, you capture more potential of compounding investment growth on prior investment growth.\\n\\nIt\\'s important to prioritize creating an emergency fund. You never know when something will come up.\\n\\n1. Do the Math: Calculate Your Net Worth and Your Budget\\n\\nRather than ignoring your finances and leaving them to chance, a bit of number crunching can help you evaluate your current financial health and determine how to reach your short- and long-term financial goals.\\n\\nCalculating Net Worth\\n\\nAs a starting point, it is important to calculate your net worth: the difference between what you own and what you owe. To calculate your net worth, start by making a list of your assets (what you own) and your liabilities (what you owe). Then, subtract the liabilities from the assets to arrive at your net-worth figure.\\n\\nYour net worth represents where you are financially. It\\'s normal for the figure to fluctuate over time. Calculating your net worth one time can be helpful, but the real value comes from making this calculation on a regular basis (at least yearly). Tracking your net worth over time allows you to evaluate your progress, highlight your successes, and identify areas requiring improvement.\\n\\nNet worth is highly dependent on age. It\\'s common for a younger investor to have a low or negative net worth when they start their career, while an older individual might have a higher net worth further in their career.\\n\\nCalculating a Personal Budget\\n\\nEqually important is developing a personal budget or spending plan. Created on a monthly basis, a personal budget is an important financial tool because it can help you plan for future costs, reduce unnecessary spending, save for future goals, and prioritize where you put your money.\\n\\nThere are numerous approaches to creating a personal budget, but all involve making projections for income and expenses. The income and expense categories you include in your budget will depend on your situation and can change over time. Common income categories include:\\n\\nAlimony\\n\\nBonuses\\n\\nChild support\\n\\nDisability benefits\\n\\nInterest and dividends\\n\\nRents and royalties\\n\\nRetirement income\\n\\nSalaries/wages\\n\\nSocial Security\\n\\nTips\\n\\nGeneral expense categories include:\\n\\nChildcare/eldercare\\n\\nDebt payments (car loan, student loan, credit card)\\n\\nEducation (tuition, books, supplies)\\n\\nEntertainment and recreation (sports, hobbies, books, movies, DVDs, concerts, streaming services)\\n\\nFood (groceries, dining out)\\n\\nGiving (birthdays, holidays, charitable contributions)\\n\\nHousing (mortgage or rent, maintenance)\\n\\nInsurance (health, home/renters, auto, life)\\n\\nMedical/Health Care (doctors, dentists, prescription medications)\\n\\nPersonal (clothing, hair care, gym, professional dues)\\n\\nSavings (retirement, education, emergency fund, specific goals such as a vacation)\\n\\nSpecial occasions (weddings, anniversaries, graduations, bar/bat mitzvahs)\\n\\nTransportation (gas, taxis, subway, tolls, parking)\\n\\nUtilities (phone, electric, water, gas, cell, cable, internet)\\n\\nA budget is only useful if it is followed. After you prepare a personal budget, track your income and spending across categories. Then, refine your budget based on what actually happened.\\n\\nOnce you’ve made the appropriate projections, subtract your expenses from your income. If you have money left over, you have a surplus, and you can decide how to spend, save, or invest the money. If your expenses exceed your income, however, you will have to adjust your budget by increasing your income (adding more hours at work, getting a raise, or picking up a second job) or by reducing your expenses.\\n\\n2. Manage Lifestyle Inflation\\n\\nMost individuals will spend more money if they have more money to spend. As people advance in their careers and earn higher salaries, there tends to be a corresponding increase in spending, a phenomenon known as “lifestyle inflation.”\\n\\nEven though you might be able to pay your bills, lifestyle inflation can be damaging in the long run because it limits your ability to build wealth. Every extra dollar you spend now means less money later and during retirement, and higher disposable income today doesn\\'t guarantee higher income in the future.\\n\\nAs your professional and personal situation evolves over time, some increases in spending are natural. You might need to upgrade your wardrobe to dress appropriately for a new position, or, as your family grows, you might need a house with more bedrooms. With more responsibilities at work, you might find that it makes sense to hire someone to mow the lawn or clean the house, freeing up time to spend with family and friends and improving your quality of life.\\n\\nAs you enter into different phases of life, re-evaluate your personal budget to have it reflect the right conditions in your life. When preparing a list of your expenses, evaluate which costs are truly needed and which you can go without.\\n\\nA helpful scenario is to consider what changes you would make if you were to receive a pay cut at work. If your income were to be cut by 20%, how would that impact your spending or saving?\\n\\n3. Recognize Needs vs. Wants, and Spend Mindfully\\n\\nIt’s in your best interest to be mindful of the difference between “needs” and “wants.” Needs are things you have to have in order to survive: food, shelter, healthcare, transportation, and a reasonable amount of clothing. It\\'s also important to set aside money each month for savings, although that is much more contingent on your other needs being met first.\\n\\nConversely, wants are things you would like to have but don’t require for survival. These costs may be engrained in our daily lives, so they may feel like needs. Whether it\\'s a streaming subscription that you use several times per week or a morning treat that is now part of your daily routine, wants are items that are non-essential.\\n\\nThis line between \"wants\" and \"needs\" is blurred for essentials when there is no defined level of either. A car is a good example. Depending on your city\\'s public transportation, you might be able to make the case that a car is a \"want.\" However, for the many of us who consider it a \"need,\" what type of car is appropriate? What is an appropriate balance between a higher car payment and a nicer vehicle?\\n\\nYour needs should get top priority in your personal budget. Only after your needs have been met should you allocate any discretionary income toward wants. Again, if you do have money left over each week or each month after paying for the things you really need, you don’t have to spend it all.\\n\\nSaving money for the future is a need as long as your current physical needs (food, shelter, transportation) are met. In addition, some argue that obtaining a 401(k) match by your employer is a high priority.\\n\\n4. Start Saving Early\\n\\nIt’s often said that it’s never too late to start saving for retirement. That may be true (technically), but the sooner you start, the better off you’ll likely be during your retirement years. This is because of the power of compounding.\\n\\nCompounding involves the reinvestment of earnings, and it is most successful over time. The longer earnings are reinvested, the greater the value of the investment, and the larger the earnings will be.\\n\\nTo illustrate the importance of starting early, assume you want to save $1,000,000 by the time you turn 60, and you expect to earn 5% interest each year.\\n\\nIf you start saving when you are 20 years old, you would have to contribute $655 a month—a total of $314,544 over 40 years—to be a millionaire by the time you hit 60.\\n\\nIf you start saving when you are 40 years old, you would have to contribute $2,433 a month—a total of $583,894 over 20 years.\\n\\nIf you start saving when you are 50 years old, you would have to contribute $6,440 each month —a total of $772,786 over 10 years.\\n\\nThe sooner you start, the easier it is to reach your long-term financial goals. You will need to save less each month and contribute less overall to reach the same goal in the future.\\n\\n5. Build and Maintain an Emergency Fund\\n\\nAn emergency fund is just what the name implies: money that has been set aside for emergency purposes. The fund is intended to help you pay for things that wouldn’t normally be included in your personal budget. This includes unexpected expenses such as car repairs or an emergency trip to the dentist. It can also help you pay your regular expenses if your income is interrupted.\\n\\nAlthough the traditional guideline is to save three to six months’ worth of living expenses in an emergency fund, the unfortunate reality is that this amount would often fall short of what many people would need to cover a big expense or weather a loss in income. In today’s uncertain economic environment, you might want to aim for saving at least six months’ worth of living expenses—more if possible.\\n\\nKeep in mind that establishing an emergency backup is an ongoing mission. Odds are that as soon as it is funded, you will need it for something. Instead of being dejected about this, be glad that you were financially prepared and start the process of building the fund again.\\n\\nHow Do I Calculate My Net Worth? To calculate your net worth, make a list of everything you own and the value of each item. Then, make a list of all of your debts (like credit card debt, car loans, student loans, etc.). The difference between these two lists is your net worth. It represents the amount of money you could have if you sold everything you own and paid off your obligations.\\n\\nWhat Is Compounding? Compounding occurs when you grow money on top of the money you\\'ve already grown in the past. By saving money at an earlier age, your money is more likely to grow faster due to compounding.\\n\\nHow Much Money Should I Save Each Month? Your top priority each month is to pay for your essentials. Focus on costs like shelter, food, and transportation first. After your needs have been met, it\\'s often advised to try and save at least 10% of your take-home income. Remember, just because you have the money doesn\\'t mean you should spend it. If you\\'re able to save more now, you\\'ll have greater earning potential in the future.\\n\\nHow Big Should My Emergency Fund Be? Everyone\\'s emergency fund will be different. It\\'s often advised to have three- to six months of expenses saved in case of an emergency. This amount might be adjusted depending on your job security and your responsibilities—for example, if you have children.\\n\\nThe Bottom Line\\n\\nPersonal finance principles can be excellent tools for achieving financial success. It’s important to consider the big picture and build habits that help you make better financial choices, leading to better financial health.')),\n",

However, the prospect of something expensive and beyond your control happening becomes less threatening if you’re properly prepared. Here are 10 steps to take to ensure you can deal with an economic crisis.\\n\\nKey Takeaways Having a monthly budget is essential to keep track of your financial health.\\n\\nScrutinize your bills to see where you might be spending money on unnecessary expenses and be sure to pay your bills on time.\\n\\nMake it a priority to pay down your credit card debt and look for cards with low interest rates.\\n\\nDo the proper maintenance on everything from your home to your health to avoid expensive problems down the road.\\n\\n1. Maximize Your Liquid Savings\\n\\nCash accounts, such as checking, savings, and money market accounts—as well as certificates of deposit (CDs) and short-term government investments—will help you the most in a crisis because they are readily available. You’ll want to turn to these resources first because their value doesn’t fluctuate with market conditions, unlike stocks, index funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and other financial instruments in which you might have invested.\\n\\nThis means you can take your money out at any time without incurring a financial loss. Also, unlike retirement accounts, you won’t face early withdrawal penalties or incur tax penalties when you withdraw your money. The exception is CDs, which usually require you to forfeit some of the interest you’ve earned if you close them early.\\n\\nDon’t invest in stocks or other higher-risk investments until you have several months’ worth of cash in liquid accounts. The number of months’ worth of cash that you should have on hand depends on your financial obligations and risk tolerance.\\n\\nIf you have a major obligation, such as a mortgage or a child’s ongoing tuition payments, you might want to have more months’ worth of expenses saved up than if you’re single and renting an apartment. A three-month expense cushion is considered a bare minimum, but some folks like to keep six months or even up to two years’ worth of expenses in liquid savings to guard against a long bout of unemployment.\\n\\n2. Make a Budget\\n\\nIf you don’t know exactly how much money you have coming in and going out each month, you won’t know how much money you need for your emergency fund. And if you aren’t keeping a budget, you also will have no idea whether you’re currently living below your means or overextending yourself. A budget is not a parent—it can’t and won’t force you to change your behavior—but it is a useful tool that can help you decide if you’re happy with where your money is going and where you stand financially. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has tools to help you create and stay on a budget.\\n\\n3. Prepare to Minimize Your Monthly Bills\\n\\nYou might not have to do it now, but be ready to start cutting out anything that is not a necessity. If you can get your recurring monthly expenses as low as they can be, you’ll have less difficulty paying your bills when money is tight.\\n\\nStart by looking at your budget to see where you might currently be spending more money than necessary. For example, are you paying a monthly fee for your checking account? Explore how to switch to a bank that offers free checking. Are you paying $40 a month for a landline you rarely use? Learn how you might cancel it or switch to a lower-rate emergency-only plan. You might find ways you can start cutting your costs now just to save money.\\n\\nMaybe you're in the habit of letting the heater or air conditioner run when you’re not home or leaving lights on in rooms you aren’t using. If so, you may be able to trim your utility bills. Now might also be a good time to shop around for lower insurance rates and find out if you can cancel certain types of insurance, such as car insurance, in the event of an emergency. Some insurance companies might give you an extension, so look for the steps involved and be prepared.\\n\\n4. Closely Manage Your Bills\\n\\nThere’s no reason to waste money on late fees or finance charges, yet families do it all the time. During a job loss crisis, you should be extra vigilant in this area. Simply being organized can save you a lot of money when it comes to your monthly bills. One late credit card payment per month could set you back $300 over the course of a year. It could even get your card canceled at a time when you might need it as a last resort.\\n\\nSet a date twice a month to review all your accounts, so you don’t miss any due dates. Schedule electronic payments or mail checks so that your payment arrives several days before it’s due. This way, if a delay occurs, your payment will probably still arrive on time. If you’re having trouble keeping track of all your accounts, compile a list. When your list is complete, you can use it to make sure you’re on top of all your accounts and to see if there are any you can combine or close.\\n\\nDon’t neglect your non-cash assets, such as frequent flier miles, credit card rewards points, and gift cards.\\n\\n5. Take Stock of Your Non-Cash Assets and Maximize Their Value\\n\\nBeing prepared might include identifying all of your options. Do you have frequent flyer miles you can use if you need to travel? Do you have extra food in your house that you can plan meals around to lower your grocery bills? Do you have any gift cards you can put toward entertainment or sell for cash? Do you have rewards from a credit card that you can convert to gift cards? All these assets can help you lower your monthly expenses, but only if you know what you have and use it wisely. Knowing what you have can also prevent you from buying things you don’t need.\\n\\n6. Pay Down Your Credit Card Debt\\n\\nIf you have credit card debt, the interest charges you’re paying every month probably take up a significant portion of your monthly budget. If you make it a point to pay down your credit card debt, you will reduce your monthly financial obligations and put yourself in a position to start building a better nest egg. Getting rid of interest payments frees you to put your money toward more important things. The last thing you want in a fiscal emergency is to have outstanding debt hanging over you.\\n\\n7. Get a Better Credit Card Deal\\n\\nIf you’re currently carrying a balance, it could really help if you transfer that balance to another card with a lower rate. Paying less interest means that you can pay off your total debt faster and/or gain some breathing room in your monthly budget. Just make sure that what you save from the lower interest rate is greater than the balance transfer fee. If you’re transferring your balance to a new card with a low introductory annual percentage rate (APR), aim to pay off your balance during the introductory period, before your rate goes up.\\n\\nIt's also worth asking if your current credit card company will lower your monthly interest rate. Sometimes companies will do this to keep you as a customer; it's cheaper for them to keep an existing customer than it is to recruit a new one.\\n\\nThere are ways to earn extra money, whether it’s selling unneeded possessions, freelancing in your off hours, or even getting a second job.\\n\\n8. Look for Ways to Earn Extra Cash\\n\\nEveryone has something they can do to earn extra money, whether it’s selling possessions you no longer use (either online or in a garage sale), babysitting, chasing credit card and bank account opening bonuses, freelancing, or getting a second job. The money you earn from these activities may seem insignificant compared to what you earn at your primary job, but even small amounts can add up to something meaningful over time. Besides, many of these activities have side benefits: You might end up with a less cluttered house or discover that you enjoy your side job enough to make it your career.\\n\\n9. Check Your Insurance Coverage\\n\\nIn step three, we recommended shopping around for lower insurance rates. If you’re carrying too much insurance—or could be getting the same coverage from another provider for a better price—these are obvious changes you can make to lower your monthly bills.\\n\\nThat being said, having excellent insurance coverage can prevent one crisis from piling on top of another. It’s also worth making sure that you have the coverage you really need and not just a bare minimum. This applies to policies you already have, as well as to policies you may need to purchase. A disability insurance policy can be indispensable if you sustain a significant illness or an injury that prevents you from working, and an umbrella policy can provide coverage where your other policies fall short.\\n\\n10. Keep Up With Routine Maintenance\\n\\nIf you keep the components of your car, home, and physical health in top condition, you can catch problems while they’re small and avoid expensive repairs and medical bills later. It’s cheaper to have a cavity filled than to get a root canal, easier to replace a couple of pieces of wood than to have your house tented for termites, and better to eat healthy and exercise than end up needing expensive treatments for diabetes or heart disease. You might think you don’t have the time or money to deal with these things on a regular basis, but they can create much larger disruptions in your time and finances if you ignore them.\\n\\nHow Do I Get Help in a Financial Crisis? If you are facing a financial crisis with few, if any, resources, there are government programs that may be able to help. Programs such as SNAP, which provides food vouchers, Temporary Assistant for Needy Families (TANF), unemployment benefits, emergency housing and rent assistance, and help with utility bills are all available.\\n\\nHow Can I Get Money in an Emergency? If you have an emergency fund, that's the first source of money you should consider tapping. If you don't have one, or if you run out of those funds, consider the credit available to you. Can you get a home equity line of credit, for example, or a loan from your bank? Be sure you have a plan to repay the debt so that it doesn't snowball over time. You may also be able to borrow money or ask for a gift from a relative or a close friend. If it's a loan, consider drawing up a personal loan agreement that includes the basics—how much it is for and when and how it will be repaid. Once the crisis is past, be sure to set up an emergency fund so that you will have money set aside for next time.\\n\\nHow Do I Make Money Fast Online? You can make money online through websites like Upwork, Fiverr, and Freelancer.com, that offer freelance opportunities, such as writing, data entry, programming, or being a virtual assistant. Think about your skills—if you speak another language or can tutor students in a particular subject, you can find work online through BLEND Express or Tutor.com. You can also get paid for evaluating how well websites and apps work for a site like UserTesting.com.\\n\\nThe Bottom Line\\n\\nLife is unpredictable, but being prepared and careful can help you stave off disaster. With the right preparation, you can turn a potential financial tragedy into a temporary setback.\")),\n",

Carrying too much debt can be stressful. Getting out of debt can put you in better financial health and open more opportunities.\\n\\n\\n\\n1. Understand Your Debt\\n\\nReview all your loan statements and bills and fully understand how much debt you owe each month as well as how much interest you are paying on the different debts.\\n\\nEnsure that your monthly debt obligations and necessary expenses are below your income. If you can't afford to pay your essential bills, you will need to take steps like negotiating with lenders or securing more income.\\n\\n2. Plan a Repayment Strategy\\n\\nInstead of just putting extra money toward any of your debt, think about which debt you want to pay down first.\\n\\nTargeting high-interest debt first using the avalanche method will save you the most money in the long run. However, some people find tackling the smallest amount of debt first works better for them because it keeps them motivated.\\n\\n3. Understand Your Credit History\\n\\nCheck your credit rating and review your credit report for inaccuracies. You can get one free from each of the three credit bureaus (Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion) or from AnnualCreditReport.com. You are entitled to your free credit report at least once per year.\\n\\nYour credit report can help you understand how your debt is affecting your credit score. You can see if you have a significant number of late payments or if you have a high credit utilization ratio, meaning you use a large amount of the debt available to you.\\n\\n4. Make Adjustments to Debt\\n\\nIf your credit rating allows for it, try to get a larger, lower-interest loan and consolidate your debts into this loan. This can speed up the process of paying off your debt by minimizing the interest.\\n\\nYou may consider a balance transfer offer of 0% interest from one of your credit cards. This way, you can get a grace period from that could last anywhere from six to 18 months, depending on the offer. Be aware that if you don't pay the balance off in full before the offer term ends, you will pay the credit card's interest rate on the balance.\\n\\nIf you own a home and have equity, you may be able to use a home equity line of credit (HELOC) to pay off higher-interest debt. Lines of credit have significantly lower rates than credit cards.\\n\\n\\n\\n5. Increase Payments\\n\\nWhenever possible, double the amount of payments you make to your debt, especially for high-interest debt. Paying more than the minimum can speed up the time it takes to get out of debt.\\n\\nBy increasing your payment amount, you will be increasing the overall rate at which your debt declines and reducing the total interest you pay.\\n\\n6. Reduce Expenses\\n\\nCutting back on unnecessary expenses is a key part of getting out of debt. Review your regular expenses and identify which are necessary, such as food, housing, and utilities, and which are unnecessary, such as entertainment or new clothing.\\n\\nReducing your unnecessary expenses can give you extra money to put toward getting out of debt.\\n\\nTry to avoid closing your credit cards. Closing cards reduces the overall amount of credit available to you and increases your credit utilization ratio, both of which can hurt your credit score.\\n\\n7. Consult a Professional Financial Advisor\\n\\nMeeting with a credit counselor or financial advisor can help you understand all your options for getting out of debt. Professional advisors can guide you through the best strategies for your particular situation.\\n\\nA credit counselor also may provide support when you meet with your creditors. However, be wary of credit specialists that charge high fees.\\n\\n8. Negotiate with Lenders\\n\\nIf you are still struggling to pay your debt with your income, you can take other measures. If you are behind on your payments, you can try debt settlement with the help of a reputable debt relief company.\\n\\nWith this strategy, you negotiate with lenders to reduce the amount of debt you owe in exchange for agreeing to pay a portion of your balance. However, one drawback to turning to debt settlement is that it can negatively affect your credit score for several years.\\n\\nInvestopedia / Ellen Lindner\\n\\nHow Can You Get Out of Debt and Save Money? You can get out of debt and save at the same time, but you must budget and plan. First, always pay at least the minimum required payments on your credit cards and loans. Then, allot extra money toward paying down more debt and saving according to your goals. A debt consolidation loan or a balance transfer credit card can also help lower overall interest payments.\\n\\nHow Can You Get Out of Real Estate Debt? If your mortgage debt is too high, there are a few steps you can take to help lower it. First, you may be able to refinance your mortgage for a lower percentage rate, depending on market conditions and what you can get approved for. You can also make extra payments toward the principal on your mortgage loan, which will reduce the length of your loan and lower your interest costs.\\n\\nHow Can You Get Out of Student Debt? If you have multiple student loans, consider refinancing your loans into one payment with a lower interest rate. Research loan forgiveness programs if you have a federal student loan. It is difficult to include student debt in a bankruptcy filing, so your federal student loans may be discharged, or released, if that occurs.\\n\\nIs Credit Counseling Free? The cost of credit or debt counseling varies depending on individual counselors and state laws. For counselors who belong to the National Foundation for Credit Counseling, for example, the majority of these services are provided at no or low cost to clients.\\n\\nThe Bottom Line\\n\\nIf you can't get out of debt, you may have to declare bankruptcy, which can ruin your credit rating and make you ineligible for loans or credit for years. Consider all your options carefully and weigh their pros and cons. Consult a professional financial advisor for more specific guidance on your options for getting out of debt, including a possible debt management plan, for your situation.\")),\n",

Questions may arise about past employers (if you changed jobs) or your various sources of income. You may need to provide more recent documents.

They will consider the loan-to-value ratio, which is the percentage of the home price you need to borrow.\\n\\nThey will also look over your outstanding debts and credit history and see if you’ve had steady employment or income sources.\\n\\nAlso during this time, a home appraisal will be scheduled to determine the home's value to make sure the sales price is reasonable.\\n\\nReceive an Official Decision From the Mortgage Company\\n\\nAfter underwriting is complete, you will be officially approved or denied.

Searching for a top annual percentage yield (APY) is a good starting point when choosing a high-yield savings account, as you\\'ll want to earn a competitive rate.\\n\\nThough the interest rate can change, it makes sense to choose an account that is paying one of the highest rates in the country, since the higher your rate, the more interest you\\'ll collect every month and every year. Also, through the power of compounding, you can make interest off your interest, and the higher the APY on your account, the better.\\n\\nBut beyond the interest rate, you\\'ll also want to make sure the account either doesn\\'t have a minimum balance requirement, or has one that you feel confident you can regularly maintain. Also, note if there is a minimum balance required to earn the top APY.\\n\\nWhy Different Banks Pay Different Rates Each bank is a business that has different needs for customer deposits, operating in its own regional market. As a result, some banks have to work harder to attract funds, such as smaller banks with names you may not be familiar with. Also important is the lending activity the bank is undertaking. If, for instance, a bank is in a strategic push to build its commercial lending portfolio, it will need to attract more customer deposits in order to fund those loans it hopes to make. One way they can do this is offering a promotional APY for a short period to boost their deposits balance, but then lowering it after they\\'ve accumulated enough funds.\\n\\n\\n\\nCommon Savings Account Terms to Understand\\n\\nWhen researching high-yield savings accounts to find the best one for you, be sure you understand what these commonly used terms mean.\\n\\nMinimum opening deposit or initial deposit : Some bank accounts—whether a savings, checking, or money market account—stipulate a minimum deposit you need to make to open the account. It could be quite low, like $25, or could be as much as $25,000 for some high-balance accounts. And some accounts have no requirement, letting you open the account with no money deposited. Note that if an account has a initial deposit requirement but then no minimum ongoing balance, you do not need to keep that money at the bank after your initial deposit.\\n\\n: Some bank accounts—whether a savings, checking, or money market account—stipulate a minimum deposit you need to make to open the account.

Note that if an account has a initial deposit requirement but then no minimum ongoing balance, you do not need to keep that money at the bank after your initial deposit. Minimum balance requirement or ongoing balance : Unlike a minimum initial deposit, a minimum balance requirement refers to the least amount of money you can keep in the account on an ongoing basis. For instance, a bank may require your balance to stay at or above $100 or $1,000 for its account—or any other amount the bank prefers. Falling below the minimum requirement could mean being hit with a fee, or could instead mean you won\\'t earn the high-yield interest rate on the account. So be sure the account you choose either has no minimum ongoing balance or one that you feel confident you can always stay above.\\n\\n: Unlike a minimum initial deposit, a minimum balance requirement refers to the least amount of money you can keep in the account on an ongoing basis.

So be sure the account you choose either has no minimum ongoing balance or one that you feel confident you can always stay above. Monthly maintenance fee : Banks and credit unions charge various types of fees. Unlike ones triggered by a transaction, such as an insufficient funds fee or a wire transfer fee, the monthly service fee is a standard fee you could be charged every statement cycle. Many accounts do not have a monthly maintenance fee, while some others provide ways for you to avoid the fee each month. Be sure you understand the fee rules for any account you\\'re considering.\\n\\n: Banks and credit unions charge various types of fees.

Mobile check deposit : The ability to deposit checks using the camera on your smartphone or tablet—rather than having to take the check to a branch—is called mobile check deposit or remote check deposit. Most institutions\\' mobile apps offer this as an easy way to get money deposited into your account.\\n\\n: The ability to deposit checks using the camera on your smartphone or tablet—rather than having to take the check to a branch—is called mobile check deposit or remote check deposit. Most institutions\\' mobile apps offer this as an easy way to get money deposited into your account. External or ACH transfer: The electronic process of moving funds between two financial institutions is called an external or ACH transfer. Virtually every high-yield savings account allows you to send or receive external transfers so that you can easily move money in and out of your savings account.\\n\\nHow to Open a High-Yield Savings Account\\n\\nAfter comparing the best high-yield savings account and landing on a choice, the next step is to open the account online. Here\\'s how that generally works:\\n\\nThe bank or credit union will ask you to provide various personal information, including your social security number, since your interest earnings will be reportable to the IRS.\\n\\nThe bank\\'s account opening process will also involve security measures designed to ensure you are who you say you are.\\n\\nYou\\'ll also be presented with one or more options on how to fund your account. The most common method is by ACH transfer from another bank, and you\\'ll be provided with instructions on how to set this up.\\n\\nAlternatively, some institutions allow you to make your initial deposit with a debit card, a credit card, or even a paper check sent through the mail.\\n\\nOnce the application process is completed, you may be able to set up online banking right away, or you may need to wait a day or two for your account to be fully opened.\\n\\nTransfers between different institutions will take one to three days to complete, so be sure to keep enough of a cash cushion either in your checking account or in a linked savings account at that same institution. That way you won’t run into trouble if you can’t get funds from your high-yield account for a couple of days.\\n\\nPros and Cons of High-Yield Savings Accounts\\n\\nPros Higher APY than traditional savings accounts\\n\\nAbility to withdraw or deposit funds at any time\\n\\nExtremely safe, with virtually no risk\\n\\nExcellent vehicle for an emergency fund or saving for a big goal\\n\\nIn times of rising rates, your APY may go up Cons Earning a top yield may require opening an account with a new institution\\n\\nSome accounts have withdrawal limits of six per month\\n\\nEasy access can make it tempting to dip into savings\\n\\nAccount could have a fee or minimum balance requirement\\n\\nIn times of decreasing rates, your APY may go down\\n\\nWho Is a High-Yield Savings Account Best For?\\n\\nAnyone with surplus savings in the bank can benefit from a high-yield savings account. If you have more money in the bank than you need to hold in your checking account, high-yield savings accounts offer a way to sock some of those funds away to earn an especially high annual percentage yield (APY). High-yield savings accounts are also well suited to those comfortable with internet or mobile banking, as moving money in and out of an online savings account must generally be done on your computer or via a mobile banking app on your phone.\\n\\nWhen choosing the best savings account for you, you\\'ll want to check the rules of the account, such as whether it limits the number of withdrawals you can make in a month, and if you\\'ll be assessed a monthly maintenance fee. Lastly, check that the bank is an FDIC member (or an NCUA member if it\\'s a credit union) so that your money is insured by the federal government—up to $250,000 per depositor—should the bank or credit union fail. Online reviews of a bank\\'s customer service may also prove useful.\\n\\nAlternatives to High-Yield Savings Accounts\\n\\nHigh-yield savings accounts are just one vehicle for stashing your cash, and they often pay the highest APYs. But there are several alternatives for holding your funds until you need them.\\n\\n\\n\\nHigh-Yield Savings Account vs. Checking Account\\n\\n\\n\\nWhile the easiest place to keep surplus funds is in your checking account, this has two major downsides. First, money kept in your everyday checking account is very easy to spend, making it difficult to leave earmarked as savings. Second, checking accounts tend not to pay any interest—or if they do, the rate is a pittance. A high-yield savings account offers an opportunity to earn a reasonable return on your money.\\n\\nSome high-yield or rewards checking accounts do exist, with rates that are more competitive. But these accounts require jumping through some hoops—sometimes every month—in order to earn their high rate. Still, if you\\'re a heavy debit card user, one of the best rewards checking accounts may be a good option for you.\\n\\nHigh-Yield Savings Account vs. Traditional Savings Account\\n\\nThere is no formal definition of how high a rate needs to be to qualify as \"high yield\". In short, it\\'s up to each institution how to name their savings accounts. Traditional banks and credit unions more often offer traditional savings accounts, while online banks are more likely to offer a high-yield savings account. But again, the distinctions are fuzzy, rather than hard-and-fast rules.\\n\\nHigh-Yield Savings Account vs. Money Market Account\\n\\nA money market account operates very much like a savings account, with the exception that it allows writing checks. In the past, money market accounts typically imposed high minimum deposit requirements in exchange for higher rates than savings accounts. This has shifted in recent years, however, with savings and money market accounts both having a variety of required minimum balances—including no-minimums accounts. In addition, high-yield savings accounts often pay more competitive rates than money markets, though sometimes you can find a higher APY among the top-paying money market accounts.\\n\\nHigh-Yield Savings Account vs. Certificate of Deposit (CD)\\n\\nIf some of your savings can be socked away and not touched for a period of time, you may be able to earn a higher rate with a certificate of deposit. CDs require you to commit your funds to remain on deposit for a number of months or years, imposing a penalty if you request to withdraw the funds before the CD’s maturity date. But in exchange, your interest rate is locked and guaranteed, even if the Fed lowers rates. Our daily ranking of the best nationwide CDs can lead you to the highest available APYs no matter the CD term you choose.\\n\\n\\n\\nFrequently Asked Questions Are High-Yield Savings Accounts Safe? Some people wonder if you can lose money in a high-yield savings account. In a worst-case scenario, a savings account will pay no interest, meaning your funds don\\'t grow at all. But you would never lose the money you put into the account, other than due to fees you\\'ve been assessed. So it\\'s important to choose an account where you can easily avoid paying any fees. As for losing money due to a bank failure, the vast majority of banks—whether physical or online—are covered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), which protects banking customers by insuring up to $250,000 of their deposits per institution if the bank fails. The U.S. government similarly backs credit union customers for up to $250,000 by providing insurance through the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA). That means whether your institution is a traditional brick-and-mortar bank with branches or is an online bank or credit union, and whether it’s big or small, your deposits up to $250,000 are equally safe and protected.\\n\\n\\n\\nWho Has the Highest-Paying High-Yield Savings Account? The top-paying institutions for savings accounts vary, with no one bank perpetually leading the rate rankings. In general, the top rate contenders tend to be online operations, whether owned by a physical bank or set up as a fully online-only institution. You can always find today\\'s highest rates—currently well above 5%—and the institutions that offer them by regularly checking our ranking in this article. Or for a list that is exclusive to banks (no credit unions), you can check our daily ranking of the best banks for savings accounts.\\n\\nWhich Banks Are Paying 7% Interest on High-Yield Savings Accounts? While it would be nice to earn 7% on money held in savings, no banks or credit unions are paying that much on a regular savings account. The only account paying a 7% APY right now is a savings account for kids, but only on balances up to $1,000. Savings account rates surged in 2023 and 2024, thanks the Federal Reserve\\'s aggressive rate-hike campaign. But at its highest point, the top savings account rate available to anyone in the country reached 5.55% APY in April 2024.\\n\\nWhy Don\\'t I Recognize the Banks in Your Rankings? We track the savings account rates of over 100 banks and credit unions every weekday. While we do check the rates at big banks—including the five largest banks of Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citi, and U.S. Bank—their rates aren\\'t usually high enough to make our ranking. Meanwhile, other institutions may not qualify for our ranking because they aren\\'t available to customers in at least 40 states, or they significantly limit the balance on which you can earn their high-yield APY.\\n\\nHow Much Does a High-Yield Savings Account Get Taxed? What any bank offers in interest—whether paid on a savings, checking, money market, or CD account—will need to be reported on your annual tax return. You\\'ll be able to see on your monthly statement or online register how much you were paid each month, and at the end of the calendar year, it will be taxed along with all of your other income from employment and other sources. The bank where you hold your high-yield savings account will not tax you directly, but in January of each year, they will send you and the IRS a Form 1099-INT indicating how much interest you were paid in the previous calendar year. You must then report this interest income on your tax return.\\n\\nDo High-Yield Savings Account Rates Change? The APY on a savings account is variable, meaning what it pays when you first open your account will most likely change sometime in the future, and it can change at any time without warning. Whether the rate goes up or down, and how often it changes, is largely influenced by the Federal Reserve. When the Fed adjusts the federal funds rate, banks and credit unions often follow suit in the same direction. That said, rate changes among savings accounts are not typically a daily or weekly event. Barring recent moves by the Fed, rates often remain at the same level for weeks or months at a time.\\n\\nCan You Ever Lose Money With High-Yield Savings Account? The risk of losing money in a high-yield savings account is very low. Banks and credit unions are typically insured by the FDIC or NCUA. Interest rates on high-yield savings accounts are variable, but they are guaranteed based on the balance in the account (the bank won\\'t take that money back after paying it to you). So if you\\'re worried that a high-yield savings account comes with the same risk as investing in the stock market, think again. These accounts are much safer and there\\'s virtually no risk of losing money in the account (unless you spend it of course).\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat Are the Downsides to a High-Yield Savings Account? There are few drawbacks to putting some of your money into a high-yield savings account. The primary downside is that your money will likely reside at a different institution than where you do your primary banking. As a result, you may not be able to instantaneously transfer money from your high-yield savings to your primary checking account, as transfers between banks generally take 1-3 days. This issue can be easily handled, however, by making sure you keep some level of cash cushion at the bank where you have your checking, enabling you to make a quick transfer to checking if you need it.\\n\\nWhich Banks Do You Track for High-Yield Savings Accounts?

We determine daily rankings of the top-paying savings accounts first and foremost by the annual percentage rate (APY) offered. To qualify for our lists, the institution must be federally insured (FDIC for banks, NCUA for credit unions), and the account\\'s minimum initial deposit must not exceed $25,000.\\n\\nBanks must be available in at least 40 states. And while some credit unions require you to donate to a specific charity or association to become a member if you don\\'t meet other eligibility criteria (e.g., you don\\'t live in a certain area or work in a certain kind of job), we exclude credit unions whose donation requirement is $40 or more. If the savings account is accessible only through a mobile app, we require that the app be available on both the iOS and Android platforms.\\n\\nFor more about how we choose the best high-yield savings accounts, read our full methodology.\\n\\n')),\n",

It’s never too late to start learning, but it pays to start the soonest you can. The first steps into the world of money start with awareness about the need to be educated and immersed into good money habits, and then with education on how to do so.\\n\\nBanking, budgeting, saving, credit, debt, and investing are the pillars that support most of the financial decisions that we’ll make in our lives. At Investopedia, we have more than 36,000 articles, terms, Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs), and videos that explore these topics. We’ve spent 25 years building and improving our resources to help you make smart financial and investing decisions.\\n\\nThis guide is a great place to start, and today is a great day to do it. Let’s begin with financial literacy—what it is and how it can improve your life.\\n\\nKey Takeaways Financial literacy is the ability to understand and make use of a variety of financial skills.\\n\\nThose with higher levels of financial literacy are more likely to spend less income, create an emergency fund, and open a retirement account than those with lower levels.\\n\\nSome of the basics of financial literacy and its practical application in everyday life include banking, budgeting, handling debt and credit, and investing.\\n\\nWhat Is Financial Literacy?\\n\\nFinancial literacy is the ability to understand and make use of a variety of financial skills, including personal financial management, budgeting, and investing. It also means comprehending certain financial principles and concepts, such as the time value of money, compound interest, managing debt, and financial planning.\\n\\nAchieving financial literacy can help individuals to avoid making poor financial decisions. It can help them become self-sufficient and achieve financial stability. Key steps to attaining financial literacy include learning how to create a budget, track spending, pay off debt, and plan for retirement.\\n\\nEducating yourself on these topics also involves learning how money works, setting and achieving financial goals, becoming aware of unethical/discriminatory financial practices, and managing financial challenges that life throws your way.\\n\\nThe Importance of Financial Literacy\\n\\nIn its National Financial Capability Study the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) found that Americans with higher levels of financial literacy were more likely to make ends meet, spend less of their income, create a three-month emergency fund, and open a retirement account than those with lower financial literacy.\\n\\nMaking informed financial decisions is more important than ever. Take retirement planning. Many workers once relied on pension plans to fund their retirement lives, with the financial burden and decision-making for pension funds borne by the companies or governments that sponsored them.\\n\\nToday, few workers get pensions; instead, some are offered the option of participating in a 401(k) plan. This involves decisions that employees themselves have to make about contribution levels and investment choices. Even contributing to a 401(k) may not be enough to afford a comfortable retirement. And those without employer options need to actively seek out and open individual retirement accounts (IRAs) and other tax-advantaged retirement accounts.\\n\\nAdd to this people’s increasing life spans (leading to longer retirements), Social Security benefits that barely support basic survival, complicated health or other insurance options, more complex savings and investment instruments to select from—and a plethora of choices from banks, credit unions, brokerage firms, credit card companies, and more.\\n\\nIt’s clear that financial literacy is a must for making thoughtful and informed decisions, avoiding unnecessary levels of debt, helping family members through these complex decisions, and having adequate income in retirement.\\n\\nPersonal Finance Basics\\n\\nPersonal finance is where financial literacy translates into individual financial decision-making. How do you manage your money? Which savings and investment vehicles are you using? Personal finance is about making and meeting your financial goals, whether you want to own a home, help other members of your family, save for your children’s college education, support causes that you care about, plan for retirement, or anything else.\\n\\nAmong other topics, it encompasses banking, budgeting, handling debt and credit, and investing. Let’s take a look at these basics to get you started.\\n\\nIntroduction to Bank Accounts\\n\\nA bank account is typically the first financial account that you’ll open. Bank accounts can hold and build the money you'll need for major purchases and life events. Here’s some background on bank accounts and why they are step one in creating a stable financial future.\\n\\nWhy Do I Need a Bank Account?\\n\\nThough the majority of Americans do have bank accounts, 6% of households in the United States still don’t have one. Why is it so important to open a bank account? Because it’s safer than holding cash. Assets held in a bank are harder to steal, and in the U.S., they’re generally insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). That means you should always have access to your cash, even if every customer decides to withdraw their money at the same time.\\n\\nMany financial transactions require you to have a bank account to:\\n\\nUse a debit or credit card\\n\\nUse payment apps like Venmo or PayPal\\n\\nWrite a check\\n\\nUse an ATM\\n\\nBuy or rent a home\\n\\nReceive your paycheck from your employer\\n\\nEarn interest on your money\\n\\nOnline vs. Brick-and-Mortar Banks\\n\\nWhen you think of a bank, you probably picture a building. This is called a brick-and-mortar bank. Many brick-and-mortar banks also allow you to open accounts and manage your money online.\\n\\nSome banks are only online and have no physical buildings. These banks typically offer the same services as brick-and-mortar banks, aside from the ability to visit them in person.\\n\\nWhich Type of Bank Can I Use?\\n\\nRetail banks: This is the most common type of bank at which people have accounts. Retail banks are for-profit companies that offer checking and savings accounts, loans, credit cards, and insurance. Retail banks can have physical, in-person buildings that you can visit or they can be online only. Most offer both options. Banks’ online technology tends to be advanced, and they often have more locations and ATMs nationwide than credit unions do.\\n\\nCredit unions: Credit unions provide savings and checking accounts, issue loans, and offer other financial products, just like banks do. However, they are not-for-profit organizations owned by their members. Credit unions tend to have lower fees and better interest rates on savings accounts and loans. Credit unions are sometimes known for providing more personalized customer service, though they usually have far fewer branches and ATMs.\\n\\nAssets held in a credit union are insured by the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), which is equivalent to the FDIC for banks.\\n\\nWhat Types of Bank Accounts Can I Open?\\n\\nThere are three main types of bank accounts that the average person may want to open:\\n\\n1. Savings account: A savings account is an interest-bearing deposit account held at a bank or other financial institution. Savings accounts typically pay a low interest rate, but their safety and reliability make them a sensible option for saving available cash for short-term needs.\\n\\nThey may have some legal limitations on how often you can withdraw money. However, they’re generally very flexible so they’re ideal for building an emergency fund, saving for a short-term goal like buying a car or going on vacation, or simply storing extra cash that you don’t need in your checking account.\\n\\n2. Checking account: A checking account is also a deposit account at a bank or other financial institution that allows you to make deposits and withdrawals. Checking accounts are very liquid, meaning that they allow numerous withdrawals per month (as opposed to less liquid savings or investment accounts) though they earn little to no interest.\\n\\nMoney can be deposited at banks and ATMs, through direct deposit, or through another type of electronic transfer. Account holders can withdraw funds via banks and ATMs, by writing checks, or using debit cards linked to their accounts.\\n\\nYou may be able to find a checking account with no fees. Others have monthly and other charges (such as for overdrafts or using an out-of-network ATM) based on, for example, how much you keep in the account or whether there’s a direct deposit paycheck or automatic withdrawal mortgage payment connected to the account.\\n\\nLifeline and second-chance accounts, available at some banks, can help those who have difficulty qualifying for a traditional checking account.\\n\\n3. High-yield savings account: A high-yield savings account usually pays a much higher rate of interest than a standard savings account. The tradeoff for earning more interest on your money is that high-yield accounts tend to require bigger initial deposits, larger minimum balances, and higher fees.\\n\\nYou might be able to open a high-yield savings account at your current bank, but online banks tend to have the highest interest rates.\\n\\nWhat’s an Emergency Fund?\\n\\nAn emergency fund is not a specific type of bank account but can be any source of cash that you’ve saved to help you handle financial hardships like job losses, medical bills, or car repairs. Here's how they work:\\n\\nMost people use a separate savings account for their emergency savings.\\n\\nThe account should eventually total enough to cover at least three to six months’ worth of expenses.\\n\\nEmergency fund money should be off-limits for paying regular expenses.\\n\\nIntroduction to Credit Cards\\n\\nYou know them as the plastic cards that (almost) everyone carries in their wallets. Credit cards are accounts that let you borrow money from the credit card issuer and pay it back over time.\\n\\nFor every month that you don’t pay back the money in full, you’ll be charged interest on your remaining balance. Note that some credit cards, called charge cards, require you to pay your balance in full each month. However, these are less common.\\n\\nWhat’s the Difference Between Credit and Debit Cards?\\n\\nHere is the difference:\\n\\nDebit cards take money directly out of your checking account. You can’t borrow money with debit cards, which means that you can’t spend more cash than you have in the bank. And debit cards don’t help you to build a credit history and credit rating.\\n\\nCredit cards allow you to borrow money and do not pull cash from your bank account. This can be helpful for large, unexpected purchases. But carrying a balance every month—not paying back in full the money that you borrowed—means that you’ll owe interest to the credit card issuer. In fact, as of Q1 2024, Americans owed $1.12 trillion in credit card debt. So be very careful about spending more money than you have, because debt can build up quickly and become difficult to pay off.\\n\\nOn the other hand, using a credit card judiciously and paying your credit card bills on time helps you not only establish a credit history and a good credit rating but also have an important balance on the cards readily available when important expenses in life show up and you do not have cash on hand at that instant to pay for them. Hence, these plastics have introduced so much convenience in the lives of people in the countries where credit cards are mainstream.\\n\\nYou can see clearly the difference in countries who have not adopted largely this type of payment. The only requirement with credit cards is the discipline to pay back on time or as soon as possible. As for credit building through credit cards, it’s important to build a good credit rating not only to qualify for the best credit cards but also because you will get more favorable interest rates on car loans, personal loans, and mortgages\\n\\nWhat Is APR?\\n\\nAPR stands for annual percentage rate. This is the amount of interest that you’ll owe the credit card issuer on any unpaid balance. You’ll want to pay close attention to this number when you apply for a credit card. A higher number can cost you hundreds or even thousands of dollars if you carry a large balance over time. The median APR today is nearly 25%, but your rate may be higher if you have bad credit. Interest rates also tend to vary by the type of credit card.\\n\\nWhich Credit Card Should I Choose?\\n\\nCredit scores have a big impact on your odds of getting approved for a credit card. Understanding what range your score falls into can help you narrow the options as you decide on the cards for which you may apply. Beyond your credit score, you’ll also need to decide which perks best suit your lifestyle and spending habits.\\n\\nIf you’ve never had a credit card before, or if you have bad credit, you’ll likely need to apply for either a secured credit card or a subprime credit card. By using one of these and paying back on time, you can raise your credit score and earn the right to credit at better rates.\\n\\nIf you have a fair to good credit score, you can choose from a variety of credit card types, such as:\\n\\nTravel rewards cards : These credit cards offer points redeemable for travel—including flights, hotels, and rental cars—with each dollar you spend.\\n\\n: These credit cards offer points redeemable for travel—including flights, hotels, and rental cars—with each dollar you spend. Cash-back cards : If you don’t travel often—or don’t want to deal with converting points into real-life perks—a cash-back card might be the best fit for you. Every month, you’ll receive a small portion of your spending back, in cash or as a credit to your statement.\\n\\n: If you don’t travel often—or don’t want to deal with converting points into real-life perks—a cash-back card might be the best fit for you. Every month, you’ll receive a small portion of your spending back, in cash or as a credit to your statement. Balance transfer cards : If you have balances on other cards with high interest rates, transferring your balance to a lower-rate credit card could save you money, help you pay off balances, and help improve your credit score.\\n\\n: If you have balances on other cards with high interest rates, transferring your balance to a lower-rate credit card could save you money, help you pay off balances, and help improve your credit score. Low- or No-APR cards: If you routinely carry a balance from month to month, switching to a credit card with a low or no APR could save you hundreds of dollars per year in interest payments.\\n\\nBe aware of your protections under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA). Research credit opportunities and available interest rates, and be sure that you are offered the best rates for your particular credit history and financial situation.\\n\\nHow to Create a Budget\\n\\nCreating a budget is one of the simplest and most effective ways to control your spending, saving, and investing. You can’t begin to improve your financial health if you don’t know where your money is going, so start tracking your expenses against your income. Then set clear goals.\\n\\nOne budget template that helps individuals reach their goals, manage their money, and save for emergencies and retirement is the 50/20/30 budget rule: spending 50% on needs, 20% on savings, and 30% on wants.\\n\\nHow Do I Create a Budget?\\n\\nBudgeting starts with tracking how much money you receive and spend every month. You can do this in an Excel sheet, on paper, or with a budgeting app. It’s up to you. However you decide to track, clearly lay out the following:\\n\\nIncome : List all sources of money that you receive in a month, with the dollar amount. This can include paychecks, investment income, alimony, settlements, and money that you make from side jobs or other projects, such as selling crafts.\\n\\n: List all sources of money that you receive in a month, with the dollar amount. This can include paychecks, investment income, alimony, settlements, and money that you make from side jobs or other projects, such as selling crafts. Expenses : List every purchase that you make in a month, split into two categories: fixed expenses and discretionary spending. Review your bank statements, credit card statements, and brokerage account statements to be sure to capture them all. Fixed expenses are the purchases that you must make every month. Their amounts don’t change (or change very little) and are considered essential. They include rent/mortgage payments, loan payments, and utilities. Discretionary spending is nonessential spending or varying purchases for things like restaurant meals, shopping, clothes, and travel. Consider your wants rather than needs.\\n\\n: List every purchase that you make in a month, split into two categories: fixed expenses and discretionary spending.

They include rent/mortgage payments, loan payments, and utilities. is nonessential spending or varying purchases for things like restaurant meals, shopping, clothes, and travel. Consider your wants rather than needs. Savings: Record the amount of money that you’re able to save each month, whether it’s in cash, cash deposited into a bank account, or money that you add to an investment account or retirement account like an IRA or 401(k) (if your employer offers one).\\n\\nSubtract your total expenses from your total income to get the amount of money you have left at the end of the month. Now that you have a clear picture of money coming in, money going out, and money saved, you can identify which expenses you can cut back on, if necessary.\\n\\nIf you don’t already have one, put your extra money into an emergency fund until you’ve saved at least three to six months’ worth of expenses (in case of a job loss or other emergency). Don’t use this money for discretionary spending. The key is to keep it safe and grow it for times when your income decreases or stops.\\n\\nHow to Start Investing\\n\\nOnce you have enough savings to start investing, you’ll want to learn the basics of where and how to invest your money. Decide what to invest in and how much to invest by understanding the risks (and potential rewards) of different types of investments.\\n\\nWhat Is the Stock Market?\\n\\nThe stock market refers to the collection of markets and exchanges where stock buying and selling takes place. The terms “stock market” and “stock exchange” can be used interchangeably. And even though it’s called a stock market, other financial securities, such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs), corporate bonds, and derivatives based on stocks, commodities, currencies, and bonds, are also traded there. There are multiple stock trading venues. The leading stock exchanges in the U.S. include the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), Nasdaq, and the Cboe Options Exchange.\\n\\nHow Do I Invest?\\n\\nTo buy stocks, you need to use a broker. This is a professional person or digital platform whose job it is to handle the transaction for you. For new investors, there are three basic categories of brokers:\\n\\nA full-service broker who manages your investment transactions and provides advice for a fee. An online/discount broker that executes your transactions and provides advice depending on how much you have invested. Examples include Fidelity, TD Ameritrade, and Charles Schwab. A robo-advisor that executes your trades and can pick investments for you with little human assistance. Examples include Betterment, Wealthfront, and Schwab Intelligent Portfolios.\\n\\nWhat Should I Invest in?\\n\\nThere’s no right answer for everyone. Which securities you buy, and how much you buy, will depend on the amount of money that you have available for investing and how much risk you’re willing to take to try to earn a higher return. Here are the most common securities to invest in, listed in descending order of risk:\\n\\nStocks: A stock (also known as “shares” or “equity”) is a type of investment that signifies partial ownership in the issuing company. This entitles the stockholder to a proportion of the corporation’s assets and earnings.\\n\\nOwning stock gives you the right to vote in shareholder meetings, receive dividends (which come from the company’s profits) if and when they are distributed, and sell your shares to somebody else.\\n\\nThe price of a stock fluctuates throughout the day and can depend on many factors, including the company’s performance, the domestic economy, the global economy, the day’s news, and more. Stocks can rise in value, fall in value, or even become worthless, making them more volatile and potentially riskier than many other types of investments.\\n\\nETFs: An exchange-traded fund, or ETF, consists of a collection of securities, such as stocks. It often tracks an underlying index. ETFs can invest in any number of industry sectors or use various strategies.\\n\\nThink of an ETF as a pie containing many different securities. When you buy shares of an ETF, you’re buying a slice of the pie, which contains slivers of the securities inside. This lets you purchase a variety of stocks at once, with the ease and convenience of only one purchase—the ETF.\\n\\nIn many ways, ETFs are similar to mutual funds. For instance, they both offer instant diversification and are professionally managed. However, ETFs are listed on exchanges and ETF shares trade throughout the day just like ordinary stocks.\\n\\nInvesting in ETFs is considered less risky than investing in individual stocks because there are many securities inside the ETF. If some of those securities fall in value, others may stay steady or rise in value.\\n\\nMutual funds: A mutual fund is a type of investment consisting of a portfolio of stocks, bonds, or other securities. Mutual funds give small or individual investors access to diversified, professionally managed portfolios at a low price.\\n\\nThere are many categories of mutual funds, representing the kinds of securities in which they invest, their investment objectives, and the type of returns that they seek. Most employer-sponsored retirement plans invest in mutual funds.\\n\\nInvesting in shares of a mutual fund is different from investing in individual shares of stock because a mutual fund owns many different stocks (or other securities). Unlike stocks or ETFs that trade at varying prices throughout the day, mutual fund purchases and redemptions\\u200b take place only at the end of each trading day and at a fund's net asset value (NAV). Similar to ETFs, mutual funds are considered less risky than stocks because of their diversification.\\n\\nMutual funds charge annual fees, called expense ratios, and in some cases, commissions.\\n\\nBonds: Bonds are issued by companies, municipalities, states, and sovereign governments to finance projects and operations. When an investor buys a bond, they’re effectively lending their money to the bond issuer, with the promise of repayment plus interest. A bond’s coupon rate is the interest rate that the investor will earn.\\n\\nA bond is referred to as a fixed-income instrument because bonds traditionally have paid a fixed interest rate to investors, although some bonds pay variable interest rates. Bond prices inversely correlate with interest rates. When rates go up, bond prices fall, and vice versa. Bonds have maturity dates, which are the point in time when the principal amount must be paid back to the investor in full or the issuer will risk default.\\n\\nBonds are rated by how likely the issuer is to pay you back. Higher-rated bonds, known as investment-grade bonds, are viewed as safer and more stable. Such offerings are tied to publicly traded corporations and government entities that boast positive outlooks.\\n\\nInvestment grade bonds receive “AAA” to “BBB-” ratings from Standard and Poor’s and “Aaa” to “Baa3” ratings from Moody’s. Bonds with higher ratings will usually pay lower rates of interest than those with lower ratings. U.S. Treasury bonds are the most common AAA-rated bond securities.\\n\\nAre Banks Safe? Most bank accounts in the United States are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) up to certain limits, currently defined as “up to at least $250,000 per depositor, per FDIC-insured bank, per ownership category.” If you have a great deal of money to put in the bank, you can make sure that it’s all covered by opening multiple accounts.\\n\\nIs It Safe to Invest in the Stock Market? Stocks are inherently risky—some more than others—and you can lose money if their share prices fall. Brokerage accounts are insured by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation for up to $500,000 in securities and cash. However, that applies only if the brokerage firm fails and is unable to repay its customers. It does not cover normal investor losses.\\n\\nWhat Is the Safest Investment? U.S. Treasury securities, including bonds, bills, and notes, are backed by the U.S. government and generally are considered the safest investments in the world. However, these kinds of investments tend to pay low rates of interest, so investors do face a risk that inflation may erode the purchasing power of their money over time.\\n\\nThe Bottom Line\\n\\nThe topics in this article are just the beginning of a financial education, but they cover the most important and frequently used products, tools, and tips for getting started.

Skipping that two-week vacation, cutting down on the amount you spend dining out, and saving your next raise or bonus are also achievable methods of adding to your emergency fund.\\n\\nThe key is to add to the fund at regular intervals. Ideally, you should treat it like any other recurring bill you must pay each month. Dedicate the appropriate amount from your paycheck and set it aside. While most people have no qualms about regularly sending enormous amounts of money to credit card companies, they balk at the idea of paying themselves first. Change that equation.\\n\\nIf you are among the many investors who don’t have a rainy day fund stashed away in case of emergencies, there’s no time like the present to start saving. Even if you don’t have the fortitude to address the project with a dedicated savings program, you can start simple: Take the change out of your pockets at the end of the day and put it in a jar. Look into micro-investing platforms, such as Acorns, that round up purchases made from linked accounts and collect and invest the change.\\n\\nYou could also eat at home instead of dining out and “tip” yourself by adding a few bucks to your emergency fund. If you get cash back on your credit cards or just paid off a big debt, such as a personal loan or an automobile, put that newfound money into your fund. If you get a tax refund, deposit the check into your fund. If you manage to dedicate just $5 per day to your effort, you’ll have $1,825 at the end of the year; that’s $9,125 in just five years.\\n\\nWhere to Put the Money\\n\\nMoney market funds and high-interest savings accounts are two good places to park your emergency fund. You need safe, liquid options so that your money is accessible in times of need. These choices make it harder for you to dip into it (face it: you’ll be tempted to from time to time), and you’ll also earn a bit of return on the money.\\n\\nThe Bottom Line\\n\\nView your emergency fund like an insurance policy. Once you have it, guard it carefully. It’s not a piggy bank. You should not using it for incidental expenses. In fact, as your salary rises, be sure to up the amount to match your new situation.\\n\\nUse the fund only in the event of an emergency and spend it carefully when you do need to draw on it. Remember, once that money is spent, it always takes much longer than anticipated to replace it. Start now and save whatever you can, even if it isn’t much. Having an emergency fund gives you a better shot at weathering a crisis without running up a credit card balance or taking out a personal loan.')),\n",

Order a copy of Investopedia's What To Do With $10,000 magazine.\\n\\nMoney Market Accounts\\n\\nMoney market accounts are interest-bearing accounts at banks or credit unions that are a sort of mix between a checking account and a savings account. They are considered low risk so they can be ideal for an emergency fund. Money market accounts can provide APYs of about 3% to 4%.\\n\\nMost money market accounts are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or National Credit Union Association (NCUA), which means your money will be protected up to $250,000 per account.\\n\\nSome banks offer money market accounts that come with debit card and/or check-writing privileges, which gives you instant access to your funds. You often can make a certain number of free withdrawals per month as well.\\n\\n\\n\\nHigh-Yield Savings Accounts\\n\\nA high-yield savings account, often offered through online banks, can also provide returns while keeping your emergency fund safe.\\n\\nThese accounts generally provide higher interest rates than traditional savings accounts. You can earn 3% to 4% from many high-yield savings accounts compared to an average APY of about 0.3% from traditional savings accounts, according to the FDIC. Money in a high-yield savings account, including online-only accounts, is typically FDIC-insured.\\n\\nYou can usually access the money through an online funds transfer, outgoing wire transfer, telephone transfer, or check request.\\n\\nBe aware that if you use an online-only account, you cannot access your funds at a branch location. Some methods of accessing emergency savings in an online-only account may take several days.\\n\\nCertificates of Deposit (CDs)\\n\\nA certificate of deposit (CD) can also provide more interest than keeping your money in a checking account. Like a money market account and high-yield savings account, a CD offers FDIC protection for up to $250,000 per account.\\n\\nGenerally, CDs with longer maturities (such as five years) have higher interest rates. However, one drawback with keeping an emergency fund in a CD is that you usually must pay a penalty to cash out a CD before it matures, which makes it more difficult to access your money if you need it immediately.\\n\\nFor example, the early withdrawal penalty on a five-year CD might be six months’ worth of interest. If you cash out the CD before you have even earned six months’ worth of interest, the bank may take the penalty out of your principal.\\n\\n\\n\\nCreating a CD ladder, where you buy several smaller CDs that mature at different intervals instead of one large CD, can help you increase liquidity and avoid or minimize early withdrawal penalties.\\n\\nSome banks offer no-penalty CDs that let you withdraw your money without sacrificing any of the interest you have earned. You may earn a lower interest rate than you would with a regular CD, but your funds will be more liquid.\\n\\nHow Much of My Emergency Fund Should Be Liquid? Financial advisors often recommend keeping at least three to six months' worth of expenses in cash in highly liquid assets so that you can use them in an emergency, although the amount will vary depending on your situation.\\n\\nIs $10,000 Too Much for an Emergency Fund? The more money you have in an emergency fund, the better protected you will be if you face unexpected expenses. The amount you need for an emergency fund will depend on your own personal circumstances and financial obligations. If you have $10,000 in monthly expenses, it likely won't be enough as financial advisors recommend you have from three to six months' worth of expenses in an emergency fund. However, if your monthly expenses are $2,000, a $10,000 emergency fund may be more than enough.\\n\\nCan I Put My Emergency Fund in Stocks? You can put some of your emergency fund in stocks to try to earn money if you have a significant amount saved. However, keep in mind that stocks are fairly volatile, so you may have to sell at a loss if you face an emergency expense. Also consider that selling stocks can typically take several days, so you won't be able to access the cash instantly. Consider keeping some of your emergency fund in a more liquid asset like a money market account.\\n\\nThe Bottom Line\\n\\nEmergency fund money should be safe and easily accessible. So, if you want to invest these funds, aim for lower-risk investment choices.\\n\\nFor more guidance on how to invest your funds according to your personal situation and goals, consider consulting a professional financial advisor.\")),\n",

A Roth IRA is a tax-advantaged individual retirement account (IRA) meant primarily for long-term retirement investing. Both savings accounts and Roth IRAs can be a source of money in an emergency. Here are the differences between the two.\\n\\nKey Takeaways A savings account is an interest-bearing account that gives you easy access to your money for emergencies or short-term goals.\\n\\nIn addition to basic savings accounts, there are high-yield savings accounts that pay higher interest.\\n\\nA Roth IRA is a special type of retirement account that can also be a good source of emergency cash.\\n\\nInvestopedia / Hilary Allison\\n\\nSavings Accounts\\n\\nSavings accounts are an excellent place to keep ready cash, such as your emergency fund or money you’re amassing for short-term goals, like a summer vacation or your next car. They can also be a safe place to park money temporarily—such as the proceeds from a home sale—before you invest it elsewhere.\\n\\nIn addition to regular savings accounts, high-yield accounts pay higher interest rates. These accounts are commonly offered by online banks. Savings accounts of either kind are generally insured up to certain limits by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), depending on the institution at which they are held.\\n\\nGiven a long enough time frame, there are other choices. For example, a certificate of deposit (CD) is less liquid than a savings account, but it will often earn you a higher interest rate.\\n\\nThe nominal interest you earn on a savings account is considered part of your taxable income.\\n\\nRoth IRAs\\n\\nIRAs are intended for retirement and come in several varieties. Contributions to a Roth IRA are made with after-tax dollars and can be withdrawn at anytime without penalty. The account’s earnings can also be withdrawn tax-free if you have had a Roth account for at least five years and are 59½ or older at the time of the withdrawal. There are also some exceptions to the age 59½ requirement.\\n\\nSimilar to traditional IRAs, Roth IRA earnings compound and participants are subject to annual contribution limits and other rules. However, unlike owners of traditional IRAs or 401(k) plans, Roth IRA owners don’t have to take required minimum distributions (RMDs). Instead, they can leave their money in the Roth IRA for as long as they live and leave it to a designated beneficiary.\\n\\nMoney deposited into a Roth IRA can be invested in various vehicles. Most financial institutions limit those choices to stocks, mutual funds, bonds, and CDs. However, if you set up a self-directed IRA, you can have a wider selection, including real estate, cryptocurrencies, promissory notes, tax lien certificates, and private placement securities.\\n\\nNote Life insurance and collectibles are not allowed to be held as investments within an IRA.\\n\\nWhat Roth IRAs and Savings Accounts Have in Common\\n\\nA savings account is all about having accessible cash, and a Roth IRA offers the most accessibility to your savings of any of the tax-advantaged retirement accounts. Because the money you contribute to it is available at any time and for any reason with no penalties, it can be used as an emergency fund. With traditional IRAs and 401(k) accounts, you’ll pay income taxes and possibly an additional 10% early withdrawal penalty to access even your contributions.\\n\\nTypically, having emergency savings totaling three to six months of income is a good idea in case you ever need money in a hurry. A Roth IRA can be useful for this purpose, as you can withdraw your contributions anytime. However, there are two catches:\\n\\nNo redeposit : You generally can’t redeposit the Roth money you removed should you want to replenish your retirement savings. There is an exception: You can take a short-term loan from your IRA if you redeposit it within 60 days. This process is not intended to be a loan, but is actually an IRA rollover, except you'll put the money back instead of putting it into a new retirement account. This can be done only once a year.\\n\\n: You generally can’t redeposit the Roth money you removed should you want to replenish your retirement savings.

This process is not intended to be a loan, but is actually an IRA rollover, except you'll put the money back instead of putting it into a new retirement account. This can be done only once a year. Annual contribution limits: For 2024, the standard limit is $7,000, and the limit for those 50 and over is $8,000.\\n\\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\\n\\nIs a Savings Account Good for Saving for Retirement? No. Retirement accounts are set up expressly to help people reach their goals of having enough money in their post-work years. Savings accounts are far simpler and meant for short-term and emergency needs.\\n\\nWhat Are the Advantages of a Roth IRA? The biggest advantage of a Roth IRA is that if you follow the rules, you won’t pay taxes when you take distributions. In addition, Roth owners aren’t subject to RMDs at age 73 as owners of traditional IRAs or traditional 401(k) accounts are. Roth funds can be invested in various vehicles, such as stocks, mutual funds, bonds, and CDs. If you set up a self-directed IRA, you can even invest in real estate and cryptocurrencies.\\n\\nAre Roth IRAs Insured? Only certain holdings are insured. Cash deposits held within Roth IRAs are insured for up to $250,000 by the FDIC and NCUA. For example, if you have a CD within your IRA it will be covered by deposit insurance. However, insurance does not apply to securities such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ETFs, and other popular investments often held within Roth IRAs. So most people's Roth IRA holdings would not be protected by this insurance.\\n\\nThe Bottom Line\\n\\nBoth savings accounts and Roth IRAs have their purposes. Savings accounts can be a safe place to keep cash for emergencies and short-term goals. Roth IRAs are for long-term goals, primarily retirement. However, Roth IRAs can also be used for withdrawals in an emergency because your Roth contributions are always accessible without penalty. However, your earnings are not.\")),\n",

The purpose of an emergency fund is to improve financial security by creating a safety net that can be used to meet unanticipated expenses, such as an illness or major home repairs.\\n\\nAssets in an emergency fund tend to be cash or other highly liquid assets. This reduces the need to either draw from high-interest debt options, such as credit cards or unsecured loans, or undermine your future security by tapping into retirement funds.\\n\\nKey Takeaways An emergency fund is a financial safety net for future mishaps and/or unexpected expenses.\\n\\nEmergency funds should typically have three to six months’ worth of expenses, although the 2020 economic crisis and lockdown has led some experts to suggest up to one year’s worth.\\n\\nIndividuals should keep their emergency funds in accounts that are easily accessible and easily liquidated.\\n\\nSavers can use tax refunds and other windfalls to build up their funds.\\n\\nSome employers have established programs to encourage emergency fund saving.\\n\\nUnderstanding Emergency Funds\\n\\nYou establish an emergency fund when you put away money that is intended to be used during times of financial hardship. This includes the loss of your job, a debilitating illness, or a major repair to your home or car—not to mention the kind of major economic crisis and lockdown that happened in 2020.\\n\\nThe best size for an emergency fund depends on a number of factors, including your financial situation, expenses, lifestyle, and debts. Many financial advisors recommend saving enough to cover anywhere from three to six months’ worth of expenses, which can help you weather a modest healthcare bill or a short bout of unemployment.\\n\\nHowever, some experts argue for an even heftier cushion. Celebrity finance guru Suze Orman, for example, suggests an emergency fund that can handle up to eight months’ worth of outlays. And she made that contention well before the 2020 crisis, a stark reminder of how sudden and deep an economic slump can be.\\n\\nIndividual circumstances may dictate the specific savings level with which you’re comfortable. For example, a single adult without children may be content covering three months of expenses, while the sole breadwinner for an entire family may want to have enough to cover half a year or more. Research shows that many Americans are well short of the recommended range. In fact, a 2020 survey by the Federal Reserve found that more than one-fourth of Americans lacked the ability to cover a $400 expense with cash or its equivalents. Among unemployed workers, that figure rose to 45%.\\n\\nIf you’re living paycheck to paycheck, you may want to start with more modest goals, such as putting 2% of your net income into a rainy day fund and slowly increasing your contribution rate every few months. Even a modest safety net can help buy you a little time should you face an unforeseen financial crisis.\\n\\nIt may be tempting to use your fund for incidental or frivolous purposes, so make sure that you don’t deplete this resource for any purpose other than an actual emergency.\\n\\nHow to Build an Emergency Fund\\n\\nStarting early is the key to setting up an emergency fund, because it helps you build up a comfortable cushion against unexpected emergencies later in life. Getting a start on emergency funds is relatively easy. Here are two simple ways to begin saving for one.\\n\\nSet aside a comfortable amount from your salary each month. Calculate your living expenses for the desired period, and make that your target for an emergency fund. You can then divert a portion of your paycheck—perhaps by setting up an automatic transfer—to that account each month. Once the fund is built up, invest extra savings for the long term or other goals, such as the down payment on a mortgage. Once you’ve maxed out your retirement savings, that money could go into an investment account with higher risks and rewards.\\n\\nCalculate your living expenses for the desired period, and make that your target for an emergency fund.

Once the fund is built up, invest extra savings for the long term or other goals, such as the down payment on a mortgage. Once you’ve maxed out your retirement savings, that money could go into an investment account with higher risks and rewards. Save your tax refund. You may be tempted to think of a tax refund or stimulus check as extra money for discretionary spending. Instead, consider diverting it toward your emergency fund to give you an added financial cushion.\\n\\nYou probably want to park your emergency fund in a vehicle that can be easily liquidated should a financial need suddenly arise. While storing cash in a savings account may be the safest approach, there are other relatively secure ways to store a part of your emergency fund that offer greater interest-earning potential. These include high-interest savings accounts, money market accounts, and no-penalty certificates of deposit (CDs), which don’t charge savers a fee if they need to pull their money out before the maturity date. You’ll have the access you need in an emergency but won’t be incurring fees and time delays associated with other vehicles, such as brokerage accounts.\\n\\nYou may want to build an emergency fund before venturing into volatile investment vehicles such as stocks. The latter offer greater long-term growth potential than cash and cash equivalents, but their value can suddenly decrease in the event of an economic downturn, as the 2020 economic crisis and lockdown made vividly clear. Should that be the moment when you need to tap them, you could lose more value. An emergency fund protects your portfolio against that risk.\\n\\nTip Want more advice for saving money toward your financial goals?

Here’s a sampling of programs from three major companies.\\n\\nTruist Financial Corp.: Through its Truist Momentum program, the parent of SunTrust and BB&T banks offers $750 to employees who complete an eight-part financial education program, then open and fund an emergency savings account. More than 48,000 employees have graduated as of Aug. 6, 2021, according to the company.\\n\\nThrough its Truist Momentum program, the parent of SunTrust and BB&T banks offers $750 to employees who complete an eight-part financial education program, then open and fund an emergency savings account.

Levi Strauss & Co.: The apparel brand gives hourly employees up to $240 each in matching funds through its Red Tab Foundation when they make qualifying contributions to their savings accounts over a six-month period. Workers also receive a $20 bonus when they link their bank account to the company’s online platform.\\n\\nThe apparel brand gives hourly employees up to $240 each in matching funds through its Red Tab Foundation when they make qualifying contributions to their savings accounts over a six-month period. Workers also receive a $20 bonus when they link their bank account to the company’s online platform. Prudential Financial Inc.: Retirement plans administered by Prudential allow employees to divert part of their paycheck toward a savings account, encouraging them to create a financial safety net. This feature serves as after-tax emergency savings and allows employees to withdraw the funds if an emergency arises, while preserving their before-tax retirement contributions.\\n\\nExample of an Emergency Fund\\n\\nHere’s a hypothetical example showing how to assemble an emergency fund. Let’s say a married couple has monthly expenses totaling $5,000. This includes the couple’s mortgage payments, food bills, car payments, and other necessary outlays. Using the three-month rule, the couple needs to set aside at least $15,000 (or $30,000 for six months and $40,000 for eight months) to address any unexpected financial burdens.\\n\\nHow much should I have in an emergency fund? The amount varies according to your living expenses, but the general rule of thumb is to eventually save three to six months of living expenses.\\n\\nHow can I create an emergency fund if I am living paycheck to paycheck? It won’t be easy, but instead of worrying about your eventual savings amount, decide on a percentage of take-home pay that you can do without. It can be 1% or 2%.

The competition on savings rates has skyrocketed, creating a new category of high-yield savings accounts.\\n\\nKey Takeaways The interest rates on high-yield savings accounts can be 10 to 12 times higher than traditional savings account returns, and up to 15 times the FDIC national average.\\n\\ntimes higher than traditional savings account returns, and up to 15 times the FDIC national average. Online banks tend to offer the highest rates.\\n\\nElectronic transfers are easy to set up between a high-yield savings account and your checking account, even if at different banks.\\n\\nWhen shopping for a high-yield savings account, compare factors such as initial deposit requirements, interest rates, minimum balance requirements, and fees.\\n\\nWhat Makes a High-Yield Saving Account Different?\\n\\nA high-yield savings account differs in a few ways, but there\\'s one thing it has in common with traditional savings accounts that is important for all to know. Traditional savings accounts and their high-yield counterparts are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) and the National Credit Union Association (NCUA). When you open an account at a bank or credit union, all of your accounts combined are insured for up to $250,000.\\n\\nMany brokerages offer cash management accounts (CMAs), which function similarly to high-yield savings accounts. The CMA usually offers a lower rate, but they do offer bill payment and ATM debit cards.\\n\\nInterest Rates\\n\\nThe difference in interest between high-yield savings account rates and the national average is significant.\\n\\nFor instance, if you\\'re holding $5,000 in a conventional savings account, and the national average rate is 0.46% annual percentage yield (APY), you would earn $23.05 over a year. If you instead put that same $5,000 in an account earning 4.50%, you\\'d earn $229 in interest.\\n\\nThe same can be said of high-yield checking accounts. However, checking accounts of this nature usually require you to hold a significant balance and use a debit card frequently.\\n\\nNote A high-yield savings account has a variable interest rate that can change over time. It also allows you to withdraw money when you need it. Your bank may have withdrawal limits, so check what that is first before withdrawing frequently.\\n\\nOnline Access\\n\\nSome of the best savings interest rates are found at online banks, where the institution doesn\\'t have to pay brick-and-mortar overhead. So, to earn significantly more interest with your savings, you may need to hold your savings account at one institution and your checking account at another.\\n\\nToday\\'s availability and execution speeds of electronic transfers between institutions make moving money between a checking account and a savings account relatively simple, even at different banks.\\n\\nAdditional Services\\n\\nUnlike traditional brick-and-mortar institutions that offer a one-stop shop for all your banking needs, banks offering high-yield savings accounts typically limit their features or offer few or no other products. Many don\\'t offer checking accounts, and few provide ATM cards. Generally, you can make electronic bank transfers or mobile check deposits for withdrawals and deposits.\\n\\nTip Want more advice for saving money toward your financial goals? Order a copy of Investopedia\\'s What To Do With $10,000 magazine.\\n\\nHow to Use a High-Yield Savings Account\\n\\nA high-yield savings account will likely comprise only a part of your overall financial portfolio. Consider how you\\'ll best use the account with other accounts to fit your broader investment strategy.\\n\\nEmergency Savings\\n\\nDetermine how much cash to set aside according to your goals and budget. For instance, if your savings account is serving as an emergency fund, consider depositing at least three to six months\\' worth of living expenses and keeping it there until you need it.\\n\\nGoal-Oriented Savings\\n\\nThe strategy may differ if you use a high-yield account to save up for a large purchase, such as a house, a car, or a vacation. In that case, you may want to use a high-paying savings account to help you protect your principal while applying interest earnings to your savings goal.\\n\\nHaving multiple savings accounts may help you more easily progress toward goals and keep your funds organized toward specific goals. Many banks allow you to open multiple savings accounts and even give them personalized nicknames like \"Car Fund,\" \"Hawaii Vacation,\" or something else.\\n\\nEarning Interest\\n\\nYou may want to open a high-yield savings account to keep cash. Most checking accounts don\\'t pay any interest, and those generally offer meager interest rates, so moving extra funds into savings when you don\\'t need them can provide a higher monthly interest payment.\\n\\n\\n\\nHowever, a savings account\\'s interest rate is variable. It can go up and down. If the Federal Reserve lowers the fed funds rate, you might not earn the same interest rate as last month. If you want a stable, fixed interest rate (in exchange for not touching it for a set period of time), consider opening a certificate of deposit (CD). Regardless of the account, remember that your interest earnings will be taxed each year.\\n\\nWhat To Look for in a High-Yield Savings Account\\n\\nWhether you\\'re shopping for a high-yield account at a new bank or opening one at your current bank, compare options across the marketplace. Differences in interest rates and fees can add up over time, especially if you\\'re keeping a relatively large balance in savings. Here\\'s what to look for and compare.\\n\\n1. Interest Rate\\n\\nHow much interest does the account currently pay? Is it a standard rate or an introductory promotional rate? Savings account rates are variable and can be changed at any time. However, some accounts will specify that the currently advertised rate is only available for an initial period of time.\\n\\n2. Required Initial Deposit\\n\\nHow much money is required to open the account? Do you want to deposit the minimum deposit requirement? Some accounts have minimum or maximum initial balance thresholds for earning the promoted rate.\\n\\n3. Minimum Balance Required\\n\\nHow much money are you required to keep in the account? Falling below the minimum deposit requirement can result in fees, which offset the interest rate earnings.\\n\\n4. Fees\\n\\nDoes the bank or credit union charge any fees on this account? If so, how can you avoid them (maybe you always keep your balance above the minimum threshold)?\\n\\n5. Links to Other Banks and/or Brokerage Accounts\\n\\nWill the bank allow you to create links between your high-yield savings account and deposit accounts at other banks or brokerage firms? Are there restrictions on linking multiple accounts, or is there a waiting period for new accounts?\\n\\n6. Accessing Your Money\\n\\nWhat additional options, if any, are available for withdrawing funds? Can you withdraw funds from savings using an ATM card?\\n\\n7. Deposit Options\\n\\nIf you want to deposit checks into the account, does the bank have a smartphone app that offers mobile check deposits? Otherwise, can you mail checks by snail mail or deposit checks at a fee-free ATM?\\n\\n8. Compounding Method\\n\\nBanks can compound interest daily, monthly, quarterly, semiannually, or annually. More frequent compounding will theoretically increase your take-home yield. If you compare accounts by APY instead of annual interest rate, the compounding factor will already have been considered.\\n\\nHow to Open a High-Yield Savings Account\\n\\nIf your bank offers a competitive, high-yield savings account, it should be easy to open a new account. It will likely be possible with little need to enter personal information because you will already be verified with the institution.\\n\\nIf you\\'re opening a savings account at a new institution, the process will be more involved but should still be simple. Almost all high-yield savings accounts can be opened online. You will likely need to complete an electronic application with key personal information. Have your driver\\'s license, Social Security number, and primary bank account information on hand to transfer funds for your initial deposit.\\n\\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\\n\\nWhere Can a Consumer Find a High-Yield Savings Account? Online banks are offering the highest rates. Still, you may be able to open a high-yield savings account where you already bank. Compare rates and terms among several accounts.\\n\\nWhat Are the Main Things To Look at in a High-Yield Account? Research and compare factors such as initial deposit requirements, interest rates, minimum balance requirements, fees, links to other banks and/or brokerage accounts, access to your money, deposit options, and compounding methods.\\n\\nCan You Withdraw Money From a High-Yield Savings Account? Yes. Consumer banking customers can withdraw or transfer cash out of a high-yield savings account. Previously, the law allowed you to only withdraw up to six times per month from a savings account. That law is no longer in effect, but some institutions may have their own rules concerning withdrawals.\\n\\nWhich Is Better, a High-Yield Savings Account or a CD? If you want certain returns, a CD is better as it offers a fixed interest rate over a specific period of time. You can even get a 3-year CD that pays the same rate for three years. A high-yield savings account\\'s interest rate can go up or down, and there\\'s no guarantee that the APY advertised today will still be in effect six months from now. If you want more access to your cash or are still building your savings, a high-yield savings account could be better. You can add to or withdraw funds anytime. With a CD, you\\'ll generally pay an early withdrawal penalty if you need the cash. Consider carefully the pros and cons of certificates of deposit vs. savings accounts.\\n\\nThe Bottom Line\\n\\nA high-yield savings account can be an ideal place to keep money you are not using in the short term but that you want fairly easy access to. It offers higher returns than a traditional savings account and is low risk because your deposits are federally insured up to $250,000. Consider the pros and cons of high-yield savings accounts compared to your other options, such as investment accounts. Then, compare the terms of different accounts to find a high-yield savings account that best suits your goals and personal situation.')),\n",

consumer credit report. When attempting to qualify for loans, credit cards, or lines of credit, lenders take your credit score into account. Your score determines in part whether you’re approved for new credit and what interest rate you'll receive on money that you borrow.\\n\\nKey Takeaways Having a good credit rating is essential to obtaining good terms on loans, credit cards, and other financial aspects of life.\\n\\nKnowing what's on your credit report can help you establish a good credit rating, as it will notify you of what is bringing down your score and what might be troubled areas or inaccurate information.\\n\\nThe most popular credit score is the FICO score. Another common credit score is the VantageScore.\\n\\nPersonal information, credit accounts, collection items, public records, and inquiries are some of the items included in a credit report.\\n\\nThe FICO score is based on payment history, credit utilization, amounts owed, length of credit history, credit mix, and new credit.\\n\\nHow to Read Your Consumer Credit Report\\n\\nAt first glance, a credit report can seem like a jumble of numbers, but once you know what you’re looking at, it becomes easier to decipher. Generally, credit reports are broken down into five main sections.\\n\\nPersonal Information\\n\\nYour credit history is linked to your Social Security number. Your name, date of birth, and current address will also be listed on your credit report. Your previous addresses, employment history, and any other names you’ve gone by, such as a maiden name, would also be included.\\n\\nThe three main credit rating agencies are Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion.\\n\\nCredit Accounts\\n\\nThis is likely the largest section of your credit report, depending on how long you’ve been using credit. Here you’ll find details for all your current and past credit accounts, including the type of account, the creditor’s name, current balance, total credit limit, payment history, and the date the account was opened and closed.\\n\\nCollection Items\\n\\nWhen a debt goes unpaid, your creditor can turn it over to a collection agency. Once an account goes to collections, it can appear on your credit report. Collection items can be very damaging to your score.\\n\\nPublic Records\\n\\nIf a debt collector sues you for an unpaid debt and wins, the court will enter a judgment against you. Judgments can appear on your credit report, as can any related actions to collect what’s owed, such as a wage garnishment. Foreclosures and bankruptcies would also be included in the public records section.\\n\\nInquiries\\n\\nWhen you apply for new credit, the lender may check your credit report and score. This is called a hard inquiry. Each new inquiry for credit will land on your credit report. The exception to the rule is inquiries that don’t involve a check of your credit report, including any time you check your own report or score.\\n\\nCredit checks made by employers and credit card issuers for preapprovals are not entered on your credit report. These are considered soft checks, or soft pulls.\\n\\nWho Generates Credit Scores?\\n\\nCredit scores don’t just appear out of thin air. They’re calculated using the information in your credit report. The FICO score, originally developed by the Fair Isaac Corporation, is the most popular with lenders. This score ranges from 300 to 850, with 850 considered the “perfect” score. The VantageScore is another credit-scoring model.\\n\\nWhile the FICO and VantageScore models use different algorithms to generate credit scores, they both rely on credit reporting agencies for information. Understanding how to read your credit report is the first step to better credit health.\\n\\nYour Credit Report and Credit Scoring\\n\\nKnowing how to read the information in your credit report is important for several reasons. First, it can give you a better understanding of what affects your score, positively or negatively. FICO scores, for example, are based on five specific factors:\\n\\nPayment History\\n\\nCredit Utilization or Amounts Owed\\n\\nLength of Credit History\\n\\nCredit Mix\\n\\nNew Credit\\n\\nEach factor carries a different weight in terms of how your scores are calculated. Out of the five, payment history is the most important. On-time payments can strengthen your score, while late or missed payments can cause it to drop substantially.\\n\\nThe VantageScore model uses a similar set of factors, including:\\n\\nPayment History\\n\\nAge of Credit Accounts\\n\\nUtilization\\n\\nTotal Balances/Debt\\n\\nNew Credit\\n\\nAvailable Credit\\n\\nOnce you know what’s in your report, it can be easier to recognize behaviors or trends that could be helping or hurting your score. From there, you can adopt credit habits that could help you build better credit. If you notice that you owe high balances on several of your credit cards, for example, paying down some of your debt may add points to your score.\\n\\nReviewing your credit report regularly is important for detecting errors or spotting potential signs of identity theft. New accounts opened that you don’t recognize could signal that someone is using your personal information to obtain credit. And if you see that your payments aren’t being reported correctly, you have the right to dispute those errors under the Fair Credit Reporting Act.\\n\\nTo initiate a dispute, contact the credit bureau reporting the information online or by mail. You’ll need to give it your name, account number, and the nature of the information you’re disputing. The credit bureau is required to investigate, usually within 30 days. If your dispute is valid, the error must be removed or corrected. If not, the credit bureau must let you know in writing why the information won’t be changed.\\n\\nWhat Is a Consumer Credit Report? A consumer credit report is a statement that depicts your credit activity and most recent credit profile. It shows the status of an individual's credit accounts, whether open, closed, or delinquent, credit limits, account balances, and payment history. It also includes personal information, such as your name and Social Security number, and public records, such as liens, collections, and bankruptcies.\\n\\nWhat Type of Information Is Not Found on a Consumer’s Credit Report? Information not included on your credit report includes your personal buying habits, your marital status, your medical information, bank or investment balances, your education history, criminal records, and your credit score.\\n\\nWhat Does a Full Credit Report Look Like? A full credit report looks like a financial statement, depicting various information on an individual's credit profile. It has personal information on the top and is broken down by the various credit that an individual has, such as credit cards, loans, and mortgages, as well as other sections, such as public records.\\n\\nThe Bottom Line\\n\\nCredit reports can seem complicated, but they can be a valuable tool for improving your credit rating. Remember, however, that negative items—including past-due payments and collections—can stay on your credit report for up to seven years; bankruptcies can remain on for up to 10 years. Checking your report regularly can help you build a stronger credit history, which can work in your favor down the line as you seek out new loans or lines of credit.\")),\n",

For example, a debit card takes funds directly from your bank account, while a credit card is linked to a credit line that you can pay back later. Discover how debit and credit cards work and which financial situations one card might be better than the other.\\n\\nKey Takeaways Debit and credit cards both allow cardholders to obtain cash and make purchases.\\n\\nDebit cards are linked to the user's bank account and are limited by how much money is in the account.\\n\\nCredit cards provide you with a line of credit they can borrow against as needed and pay back later.\\n\\nCredit cards charge interest on the money the cardholder borrows unless it's paid back within the grace period.\\n\\nCredit cards help build your credit history, while debit cards don't.\\n\\nInvestopedia / Sabrina Jiang\\n\\nHow Debit Cards Work\\n\\nBanks issue debit cards to their customers so they can make purchases or obtain cash without having to write a paper check or visit a teller at the bank. The card is linked to your checking account or sometimes a savings account.\\n\\nHow to Use a Debit Card\\n\\nDebit cards can be used for withdrawals at automatic teller machines (ATMs) as well as for purchases at retailers in-store and online. When the card is used in a transaction, the money comes out of the linked account either immediately or after a brief interval. If you don't have enough money in the account to cover the transaction, your card may be rejected.\\n\\nPIN and Validation Codes\\n\\nDebit cards have a unique personal identification number (PIN), which you input on the ATM keypad or the merchant's point-of-sale terminal. However, with online transactions, you may be asked for the card's validation code located on the back of the card as a security measure.\\n\\nDebit Card Network\\n\\nMost debit cards are linked to a processing network, such as Visa or Mastercard, allowing them to be used anywhere cards in that network are accepted. Although most debit cards link to your bank account, offline debit cards are not electronically connected to your account.\\n\\nHow Credit Cards Work\\n\\nCredit cards are also issued by banks but require a separate application process. You don't need to open or maintain a bank account with the company to apply.\\n\\nHow to Use a Credit Card\\n\\nRather than being linked to a bank account, credit cards have a credit line that the user can borrow against, usually up to a certain preset limit. Also, like debit cards, credit cards can often be used at ATMs to get cash, although cash advances on a credit card can be costly in terms of fees and interest.\\n\\nHow Credit Cards Charge Interest\\n\\nCard issuers charge interest on the money the cardholder borrows, although cardholders can often avoid interest if they pay back their full balance within their card's grace period.\\n\\nCredit Card Network\\n\\nLike debit cards, credit cards typically belong to a card network like Visa and Mastercard and can be used anywhere cards in that network are accepted. Private label or store credit cards are an exception since they are only valid at a particular retail chain.\\n\\n\\n\\n4 Key Differences Between Debit and Credit Cards\\n\\nIn addition to the distinctions mentioned above, debit and credit cards have some other differences. Among the most important ones:\\n\\nWhich Is Better: a Credit Card or a Debit Card?\\n\\nBoth credit and debit cards can be handy when managing your personal finances, and can be nearly impossible to avoid using them in today's financial world. Some merchants don't accept cash or checks anymore.\\n\\nCredit cards can be especially useful if you need to make a purchase or face a financial emergency and don't have enough cash available in your checking account. However, credit cards can get you into financial trouble if you don't pay down the balance and interest accrues and compounds, increasing your debt.\\n\\nConversely, debit cards can help you stay within your budget and avoid spending money you don't have in your account. Since debit cards don't involve borrowing money, you don't get charged interest. However, it's important to manage your money in your checking account because if you overspend with a debit card, you may not have the funds needed for critical expenses like rent or food.\\n\\nIf you're trying to build or repair your credit history, a credit card used responsibly can help. In fact, some credit cards offer credit builder features, such as student credit cards, starter credit cards, and secured credit cards.\\n\\nIt's important to monitor your credit reports for suspicious activity and report any suspected fraud to the three major credit bureaus. Also, you can set up a free fraud alert with one of the credit bureaus to monitor unauthorized financial activity.\\n\\nWhat Is an ATM Card? An ATM card is a form of debit card that can only be used at automatic teller machines and not for purchases in stores or elsewhere.\\n\\nWhat Is a Prepaid Debit Card? A prepaid debit card is loaded with a specific amount of money but not linked to a bank account. Prepaid debit cards can often be reloaded with more money and used repeatedly. Gift cards also work like prepaid debit cards, although they may only be accepted by a particular retailer or chain and often aren't reloadable.\\n\\nHow Long Is the Grace Period on a Credit Card? The grace periods on credit cards are usually at least 21 days long and sometimes longer.\\n\\nThe Bottom Line\\n\\nDebit and credit cards allow you to make purchases and withdraw cash. However, debit cards are linked to your bank account, limiting the size of your financial transactions by the amount of funds in your bank account. Conversely, credit cards are not linked to your bank account. Instead, credit cards provide you with a line of credit to borrow funds for purchases and cash advances. In return, credit card companies charge you interest on the borrowed money.\\n\\n\")),\n",

Compound interest is when interest is added to your deposit, then interest is calculated on that new higher amount.\\n\\nCompound interest on a savings account is calculated on principal and earned interest from previous periods. Essentially your earnings are reinvested and future interest is earned on the higher amount.\\n\\nLearn more about how interest on a savings account works, including how banks use your savings deposits to fund loans.\\n\\n\\n\\nKey Takeaways Banks state their savings interest rates as an annual percentage yield (APY), which includes compounding.\\n\\nCompound interest is interest calculated on principal and earned interest from previous periods.\\n\\nSimple interest is only calculated based on principal.\\n\\nInterest compounded over a long enough time period can help your savings grow faster.\\n\\nSavings account interest rates can help you grow your money. A bank essentially borrows money from their depositors by using the deposited funds to lend money to other customers. In turn, the bank pays the depositor interest for their savings account balance while simultaneously charging their loan customers a higher interest rate than what was paid to their depositors.\\n\\nIf you reinvest the interest you earned on your savings account and the initial amount deposited, you'll earn even more money in the long term.\\n\\nCompounding is when you earn interest on your savings plus interest on all of the accumulated interest from previous periods. You can use the concept of compounding interest to build up your savings and create wealth.\\n\\n\\n\\nInterest on savings accounts is expressed in percentage terms. For example, let's say you have $1,000 in the bank. The account might earn 2.5% interest. Most banks paid less than 1% interest on savings accounts in the between 2021 and 2022 due to historically low interest rates. However, in March 2022, the Fed began raising rates after a two-year period of near-zero interest rates.\\n\\n\\n\\nCompounding Interest\\n\\nIn a straightforward interest calculation, $1,000 in a savings account that earns 1% interest in one year would yield $1,010 (or .01 x 1,000) at the end of the year. However, that calculation is based on simple interest, paid only on the principal or the deposited funds.\\n\\nSome investors, such as retirees, might withdraw the earned interest or transfer it to another account. The interest payments act as a form of income. If the interest is withdrawn, the depositor's account will earn simple interest since no interest would be earned on any past interest.\\n\\nHowever, some depositors may opt to leave the interest earned in their savings accounts to earn more interest.\\n\\nInvestopedia / Yurle Villegas\\n\\nThe Power of Compounding Interest\\n\\nIn savings accounts, interest can be compounded, either daily, monthly, or quarterly. The more frequently interest is added to your balance, the faster your savings will grow.\\n\\nUsing an example of a $1,000 deposit and applying daily compounding every day, the amount that earns interest grows by another 1/365th of 1%. At the end of the year, the deposit would grow to $1,010.05 versus $1,010 via simple interest.\\n\\nOf course, an extra $0.05 doesn't sound like much, but at the end of 10 years, your $1,000 would grow to $1,105.17 with compound interest. The 1% interest rate, compounded daily for 10 years, has added more than 10% to the value of your investment.\\n\\nAgain, the amount earned still might not seem like much, but consider what would happen if you could save $100 a month and add it to the original $1,000 deposit. After one year, you would have earned $16.05 in interest, for a balance of $2,216.05. After 10 years, still adding just $100 a month, you would have earned $725.50, for a total of $13,725.50.\")),\n",

It also means budgeting to grow a nest egg that will allow you to retire or pursue any career you want—without being driven by the need to earn a certain amount each year.\\n\\nUnfortunately, too many people fall far short of financial freedom. Even without occasional financial emergencies, escalating debt due to overspending is a constant burden that keeps them from reaching their goals. When a major crisis—such as a hurricane, an earthquake, or a pandemic—completely disrupts all plans, additional holes in safety nets are revealed.\\n\\nTrouble happens to nearly everyone, but these 12 habits can put you on the right path.\\n\\nKey Takeaways Set life goals—big and small, financial and lifestyle—and create a blueprint for achieving those goals.\\n\\nMake a budget to cover all your financial needs and stick to it.\\n\\nPay off credit cards in full, carry as little debt as possible, and keep an eye on your credit score.\\n\\nCreate automatic savings by setting up an emergency fund and contributing to your employer’s retirement plan.\\n\\nTake care of your belongings—maintenance is cheaper than replacement—but most importantly, take care of your health.\\n\\nBeing Financially Independent Being financially independent means having sufficient income, savings, or investments to live comfortably for life and meet all of one's obligations without relying on a paycheck. That is the ultimate goal of a long-term financial plan.\\n\\n1. Set Life Goals\\n\\nWhat is financial freedom to you? Everyone has a general desire for it, but that's too vague a goal. You need to get specific about amounts and deadlines. The more specific your goals, the higher the likelihood of achieving them.\\n\\nWrite down these three objectives:\\n\\nWhat your lifestyle requires How much you should have in your bank account to make that possible What age is the deadline to save that amount\\n\\nNext, count backward from your deadline age to your current age and establish financial mileposts at regular intervals between the two dates. Write all amounts and deadlines down carefully and put the goal sheet at the front of your financial binder.\\n\\n2. Make a Monthly Budget\\n\\nMaking a monthly household budget—and sticking to it—is the best way to guarantee that all bills are paid and savings are on track. It’s also a regular routine that reinforces your goals and bolsters resolve against the temptation to splurge.\\n\\n3. Pay off Credit Cards in Full\\n\\nCredit cards and other high-interest consumer loans are toxic to wealth-building. Make it a point to pay off the full balance each month. Student loans, mortgages, and similar loans typically have much lower interest rates; paying them off is not an emergency. However, paying these lower-interest loans on time is still important—and on-time payments will build a good credit rating.\\n\\n4. Create Automatic Savings\\n\\nPay yourself first. Enroll in your employer’s retirement plan and make full use of any matching contribution benefit, which is essentially free money. It’s also wise to have an automatic withdrawal into an emergency fund, which can be tapped for unexpected expenses, as well as an automatic contribution to a brokerage account or something similar.\\n\\nIdeally, the money for the emergency fund and the retirement fund should be pulled out of your account the same day you receive your paycheck, so it never even touches your hands.\\n\\nKeep in mind that the recommended amount to save in an emergency fund depends on your individual circumstances. Also, tax-advantaged retirement accounts come with rules that make it difficult to get your hands on your cash should you suddenly need it, so that account should not be your only emergency fund.\\n\\n5. Start Investing Now\\n\\nBad stock markets—known as bear markets—can make people question the wisdom of investing, but historically there has been no better way to grow your money. The magic of compound interest alone will grow your money exponentially, but you do need a lot of time to achieve meaningful growth.\\n\\nHowever, remember that—for everyone except professional investors—it would be a mistake to attempt the kind of stock picking made famous by billionaires like Warren Buffett. Instead, open an online brokerage account that makes it easy for you to learn how to invest, create a manageable portfolio, and make weekly or monthly contributions to it automatically. We’ve ranked the best online brokers for beginners to help you get started.\\n\\nAchieving financial freedom can be very difficult in the face of growing debt, cash emergencies, medical issues, and overspending, but—with discipline and careful planning—it is possible. That is the ultimate goal of\\n\\n6. Watch Your Credit Score\\n\\nYour credit score is a very important number that determines the interest rate you are offered when buying a new car or refinancing a home. It also impacts the amount you pay for a range of other essentials, from car insurance to life insurance premiums.\\n\\nThe reason credit scores have so much weight is that someone with reckless financial habits is considered likely to be reckless in other areas of life, such as not looking after their health—or even driving and drinking.\\n\\nThis is why it’s important to get a credit report at regular intervals to make sure that there are no erroneous black marks ruining your good name. It may also be worth looking into a reputable credit monitoring service to protect your information.\\n\\n7. Negotiate for Goods and Services\\n\\nMany Americans are hesitant to negotiate for goods and services, because they're afraid that it makes them seem cheap. Conquer this fear and you could save thousands each year. Small businesses, in particular, tend to be open to negotiation, so buying in bulk or positioning yourself as a repeat customer can open the door to good discounts.\\n\\n8. Stay Educated on Financial Issues\\n\\nReview relevant changes in tax law to ensure that all adjustments and deductions are maximized each year. Keep up with financial news and developments in the stock market and do not hesitate to adjust your investment portfolio accordingly. Knowledge is also the best defense against fraudsters who prey on unsophisticated investors to turn a quick buck.\\n\\n9. Maintain Your Property\\n\\nTaking good care of property makes everything from cars and lawnmowers to shoes and clothes last longer. The cost of maintenance is a fraction of the cost of replacement, so it’s an investment not to be missed.\\n\\nLearn to know the difference between the things you want and the things you need.\\n\\n10. Live Below Your Means\\n\\nMastering a frugal lifestyle means developing a mindset focused on living a good life with less—and it's easier than you think. In fact, before rising to affluence, many wealthy individuals developed the habit of living below their means.\\n\\nThis isn’t a challenge to adopt a minimalist lifestyle. It simply means learning to distinguish between the things you need and the things you want—and then making small adjustments that drive big gains for your financial health.\\n\\n11. Get a Financial Advisor\\n\\nOnce you’ve gotten to a point where you’ve amassed a decent amount of wealth—either liquid assets (cash or anything easily converted to cash) or fixed assets (property or anything not easily converted to cash)—get a financial advisor to help you stay on the right path.\\n\\n12. Take Care of Your Health\\n\\nThe principle of proper maintenance also applies to your body—and taking excellent care of your physical health has a significant positive impact on your financial health as well.\\n\\nInvesting in good health is not difficult. It means making regular visits to doctors and dentists, and following health advice about any problems you encounter. Many medical issues can be helped—or even prevented—with basic lifestyle changes, such as more exercise and a healthier diet.\\n\\nPoor health maintenance, on the other hand, has both immediate and long-term negative consequences on your financial goals. Some companies have limited sick days, which means a loss of income once paid days are used up. Obesity and other dietary illnesses make insurance premiums skyrocket, and poor health may force early retirement with lower monthly income for the rest of your life.\\n\\nWhat Is Financial Freedom? Everyone defines financial freedom in terms of their own goals. For most people, it means having the financial cushion (savings, investments, and cash) to afford a certain lifestyle—plus a nest egg for retirement or the freedom to pursue any career without the need to earn a certain salary.\\n\\nWhat Is the 50/30/20 Budget Rule? The 50/30/20 budget rule, popularized by Senator Elizabeth Warren, is a guideline to achieve financial stability by dividing after-tax income into 3 categories of spending: 50% for needs, 30% for wants, and 20% for savings and paying down debt. We have built an easy-to-follow budgeting calculator to help you categorize and control your spending and saving—which is the essential first step toward financial freedom.\\n\\nWill a Bad Credit Score Make My Car Insurance Higher? Although some states—including California, Hawaii, Washington, Massachusetts, and Michigan—limit or prohibit the use of credit scores to determine auto insurance rates, many companies do use a credit-based scoring system to decide whether to insure you and how much you will pay.\\n\\nThe Bottom Line\\n\\nThese 12 steps won’t solve all your money problems, but they will help you develop the good habits that get you on the path to financial freedom. Simply making a plan with specific target amounts and dates reinforces your resolve to reach your goal and guards you against the temptation to overspend. Once you start to make real progress, relief from the constant pressure of escalating debt and the promise of a nest egg for retirement kick in as powerful motivators—and financial freedom is in your sights.\"))]"
